<h1>Molly Brown of Kentucky.</h1>


<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>A LETTER.</small></h2>


<p>From Miss Julia Kean to Mrs. Edwin Green.</p>

<p class="r2">
<span class="rght3">Giverny, France,</span><br />
<span class="rght2">August, 1914.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Dearest old Molly Brown of Kentucky:</p>

<p>You can marry a million Professor Edwin
Greens, B.A., M.A., Ph.D., L.D. (the last stands
for lucky dog), and you can also have a million
little Green Olive Branches, but you will still
be Molly Brown of Kentucky to all of your old
friends.</p>

<p>I came up to Giverny last week with the Polly
Perkinses. They are great fun and, strange to
say, get on rather better than most married folks.
Jo is much meeker than we ever thought she
could be, now that she has made Polly cut his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
hair and has let her own grow out. Polly is
more manly, too, I think and asserts himself occasionally,
much to Jo&rsquo;s delight. I should not
be at all astonished if his falsetto voice turned into
a baritone, if not a deep bass. He walks with
quite a swagger and talks about my wife this
and my wife that in such masculine pride that
you would not know him.</p>

<p>Paris was rather excited when we came
through last week. I have been at Quimperle
all summer and only stopped in Paris long enough
to get some paints and canvas. I had actually
painted out. Jo had written me to join her in
this little housekeeping scheme at Giverny. I
wish you could see the house we have taken. It
is too wonderful that it is ours! Such peace and
quiet! Especially so, after the turmoil in Paris.
I have seen so few papers that I hardly know
what it is all about; no doubt you in Kentucky
with your <cite>Courier Journal</cite> know more than I do.
They talk of war, but of course that is nonsense.
Anyhow, if there is a war, I bet I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
going to be Johnny on the Spot. But of course
there won&rsquo;t be one.</p>

<p>I miss Kent,&mdash;but I need hardly tell you that.
I almost gave in and sailed with him, but it was
much best for me to wait in France for my
mother and father. They are now in Berlin
waiting for the powers that be to give some kind
of a permit for some kind of a road that Bobby
is to build from Constantinople to the interior;
that is, he is to build it if he can get the permission
of the Imperial Government. What the
Germans have to do with Turkey, you can search
me, but that is what Bobby writes me. He has
done a lot of work on it already in the way of
preliminary plans. I am to hang around until
I hear from them, so I am going to hang
around with the Polly Perkinses.</p>

<p>No doubt Kent is home by this time. I envy
him, somehow. It is so wonderful to have a
home to go to. Now isn&rsquo;t that a silly line of
talk for Judy Kean to be getting off, I, who have
always declared that a Gypsy van was my idea
of bliss? I never have had a home and I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
have wanted one until lately. I fancy that winter
in Paris with your mother in the Rue Brea
was my undoing. Of course, if Bobby had been
anything but a civil engineer and Mamma had
been anything but so much married to Bobby that
she had to trot around with him from one end
of the earth to the other, why then, I might
have had a home. But Bobby is Bobby and he
wouldn&rsquo;t have been himself doing anything but
building roads, and I certainly would not have
had Mamma let him build them all by his lonesome.
The truth of the matter is, I was a mistake.
I should either never have been born or
I should have been born a boy. Geewhillikins!
What a boy I would have been! Somehow, I&rsquo;m
glad I&rsquo;m not, though.</p>

<p>I am wild to see little Mildred. It seems so
wonderful for you to be a mother. I know you
will make a great job of being one, too. Are you
going to have her be an old-fashioned baby with
the foregone conclusion that she must &ldquo;eat her
peck of dirt,&rdquo; or is she to be one of these infants
whose toys must be sterilized before she is allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to play with them, and who is too easily
contaminated to be kissed unless the kisser gargles
first with corrosive sublimate? Please let
me know about this, because kiss her I must and
will, and if I have to be aseptic before I can do
it, I fancy I had better begin right now. Here
is Polly with the mail and Paris papers. Will
finish later.</p>

<p>It has come! Actual war! We feel like fools
to have rushed off here to the country without
knowing more about the state France was in. I
can hardly believe it even now. They are asking
Americans to leave Paris, but I can&rsquo;t leave. How
can I, with Mamma and Papa in Berlin? I am
going to stay right where I am until things settle
themselves a little. The peasants even now
do not believe it has come. We are not much
more than an hour from Paris, but there are
many persons living in this village who have
never been to Paris. The old men stand in
groups and talk politics, disagreeing on every
subject under the sun except the one great subject
and that is Germany. Hatred of Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
is the one thing that there are no two minds
about. The women look big-eyed and awestruck.
There are no young men&mdash;all gone to war. They
went off singing and joking.</p>

<p class="r2">What I long for most is news. We don&rsquo;t get
any news to speak of. I am filled with concern
about Bobby and Mamma. It is foolish, as they
are able to take care of themselves, but Bobby is
so sassy. I am so afraid he might jaw back at
the Emperor. He is fully capable of calling him
to account for his behavior. Some one should,
but I hope it won&rsquo;t be Bobby.</p>

<p class="r2">Polly Perkins is going to drive a Red Cross
Ambulance. He is quite determined, so determined
that he has actually produced a chin from
somewhere (you remember he boasted none to
speak of). It is quite becoming to him, this determination
and chin, and Jo is beaming with
pride. I believe if Polly had wanted to run, it
would have killed Jo.</p>

<p class="r2">Excuse the jerkiness of this, but I am so excited
that I can only jot down a little at a time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Things are moving fast! The artists and near
artists at Madame Gaston&rsquo;s Inn are piling out,
making for Paris, some to sail for United States
and others to try to get into England. Jo and I
had determined to sit tight in our little house
with its lovely walled garden that seems a kind
of protection to us&mdash;not that we are scared, bless
you no! We just felt we might as well be here
as anywhere else.</p>

<p>This morning Jo came to breakfast looking kind
of different and yet kind of familiar&mdash;she had
cut off her hair!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to follow Polly,&rdquo; she remarked simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow him where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wherever he goes.&rdquo; And do you know,
Molly, the redoubtable Jo burst into tears?</p>

<p>I was never more shocked in my life. If your
Aunt Sarah Clay had dissolved into tears, I would
not have been more at a loss how to conduct myself.
I patted her heartily on the back but the
poor girl wanted a shoulder to weep on and I
lent her one. I tell you when Jo gets started she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
is some bawler. I fancy she made up for all
the many years that crying has been out of her
ken.</p>

<p>My neck is stiff from the wetting I got.
Nothing short of the plumber could have stopped
her. When she finally went dry, she began to
talk:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By I&rsquo;b glad Bolly didn zee be bake zuch a vool
ob byself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you had better look after your p&rsquo;s and
s&rsquo;s or you&rsquo;ll be taken up as a German spy.&rdquo; That
made her laugh and then she went on to tell me
what she meant to do, the p&rsquo;s still too much for
her but her s&rsquo;s improving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of my brofession now? I&rsquo;d
like to know that. Miniature painting will be
no good for years to come. This war is going
to be something that&rsquo;ll make everybody baint on
big canvasses. Who will want to look at anything
little? I tell you, Judy, the day of mastodons
is at hand! There&rsquo;ll be no more lap-dogs,
no more pet canaries. The one time lap-dogs will
find themselves raging lions; and the pet canaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
will grow to great eagles and burst the
silly wires of their cages with a snap of their
fingers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose fingers?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind whose! Mixed metaphors are
perfectly permissible in war time.&rdquo; I was glad
to see she could say such a word as permissible,
which meant that her storm of weeping had subsided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going as a Red Cross nurse?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nurse your grandmother! I&rsquo;m going to drive
an ambulance or maybe fly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they won&rsquo;t want a woman in the thick of
the fight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, who&rsquo;s to know? When I get a good
hair-cut and put on some of Polly&rsquo;s togs, I bet
I&rsquo;ll make as good a man as Pol&mdash;no, I won&rsquo;t say
that. I&rsquo;ll never be as good a man as he is. I&rsquo;m
going to try the aviation racket first. If they
won&rsquo;t take me, I&rsquo;ll get with the Red Cross, somehow.
I know I could fly like a bird. I have never
yet seen the wheels that I could not understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the turning of. I believe it is not so easy to get
aviators. It is so hazardous that men don&rsquo;t
go in for it. I am light weight but awfully
strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Jo, what are you going to do about your
feet?&rdquo; You remember, Molly, what pretty little
feet Jo has.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll wear some of Polly&rsquo;s shoes and stuff
out the toes. I bet I&rsquo;ll walk like Charlie Chaplin,
but when one is flying, it doesn&rsquo;t make much difference
about feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing is going to stop her. She is to start
to Paris to-morrow, and I will go, too. I know
all of you think I should stay here in G&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;until
I can get into communication with Bobby,
but Molly Brown, I can&rsquo;t do it. When
history is being made, I simply can&rsquo;t stand
aside and see it. I&rsquo;ve got to get in it by hook or
crook.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be scared&mdash;I am not going to fly! I
wish I could, but I promised Kent Brown I would
never fly with any man but him, and while it
was done in jest, in a way I still feel that a promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
must be kept. I wish I were not made that
way. I&rsquo;d like to dress up like Jo Bill Perkins
and pass as a man, and I could do it quite as well
as Jo, in spite of her having practiced being a
boy all her life, but I can&rsquo;t help thinking what
Bobby has always said to me: &ldquo;Just remember
you are a lady and you can&rsquo;t go far wrong.&rdquo;
Somehow, I am afraid if I cut off my hair and
discarded skirts, I might forget I am a lady. It
is an awful nuisance being one, anyhow.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know just what I am going to do, but
I certainly can&rsquo;t cross the Atlantic, with Bobby
and poor little Mamma somewhere in Germany,
maybe locked up in dungeons or something. I
know it won&rsquo;t help them any for me to be in
France, but at least I will be nearer to them
geographically.</p>

<p>My letter of credit on the Paris bankers will
put me on easy street financially, so as far as
money is concerned, Bobby will know I am all
right. I can&rsquo;t think the war will last very long.
Surely all the neutral countries will just step in
and stop it. The French are looking to United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
States. It is very amusing to hear the old
peasants talk about Lafayette. They seem to
think tit for tat: if they helped us out more than
a century ago, we will have to help them out
now.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t tell what I think just yet. Everything
is in too much of a turmoil. I wish I knew what
Bobby thinks. He is always so sane in his political
opinions. I get more and more uneasy
about them, Bobby and Mamma. Such terrible
tales of the Germans are coming to us. I don&rsquo;t
believe them, at least not all of them. How could
a kindly, rather bovine race suddenly turn into
raging tigers? Why should any one want to do
anything to Bobby? I comfort myself with that
thought and then I remember how hot-headed and
impulsive he is, inherited directly from me, his
daughter, and I begin to tremble.</p>

<p>Jo and I are settling up our affairs here.
Madame Gaston is to take charge of our few
belongings. I have a hunch it will be best to
lighten our luggage all we can. Jo is not going
to turn into a man until we get to Paris. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
is too funny in her envy of old Mère Gaspard
because of her big moustache. You know how
many of the French peasant women have quite
mannish beards and moustaches. Mother Gaspard
has the largest and most formidable one I
have ever seen, although she is a most motherly
old soul, not a bit fatherly.</p>

<p>I will write from Paris again. I know Kent
is in a state of grouch with himself for sailing
when he did. I believe he feels as I do about
things happening. I don&rsquo;t want houses to burn
down, but if they do burn, I want to see the fire;
I don&rsquo;t want dogs to fight, but if there is a dog
fight going on, I am certainly going to stand on
my tiptoes and look over the crowd and see them
tear each other up; I certainly don&rsquo;t want the
Nations to go to war, but if they will do it, I am
going to have experiences.</p>

<p>Please give my best love to all the family and
a thoroughly sterilized kiss to that marvelous infant.
I verily believe if it had not been for
Kent&rsquo;s overweening desire to behold that baby,
he would have waited over for another steamer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and in that way found himself in the thick of
the fight. I am glad he went, however. If Polly
Perkins developed a chin and rushed off, what
might Kent have done with an overdevelopment
of chin already there?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>THE ORCHARD HOME.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;R. F. D., late as usual,&rdquo; laughed Molly, as
Mr. Bud Woodsmall&rsquo;s very ramshackle Ford runabout
came careening through the lane and up
the hill to the yard gate. &ldquo;I fancy he has had
to stop and talk war at every mail box on his
route.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go meet him,&rdquo; said Professor Edwin
Green, rather reluctantly arising from the
chaise longue that seemed to have been built
to fit his lack of curves, he declared. He had
been sitting on the porch of the bungalow, eyes
half closed to shut out everything from his vision
but the picture of Molly holding the sleeping baby
in her arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know you want to gossip with him&mdash;now
&rsquo;fess up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I do like to hear his views of the situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in Europe. They are original, at least. He
says Yankee capitalists are the cause of it all.
Don&rsquo;t you want me to put Mildred down? She
has been asleep for half an hour,&rdquo; and the young
husband and father stood for a moment and
looked down on his treasures with what Judy
Kean always called his faithful-collie-dog eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I oughtn&rsquo;t to hold her while she is
asleep, but she seems so wonderful I can&rsquo;t bear
to let her go. I think she is growing more like
you, Edwin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like me! Nonsense! That would be a sad
thing to have wished on the poor innocent when
there are so many handsome folks in the Carmichael
and Brown family from whom she could
inherit real beauty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Edwin, you are handsome, I think. You
are so noble looking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, honey, have it your own way,&rdquo; and
he stooped and kissed her. &ldquo;I will allow that the
baby has inherited my bald head if you like&mdash;Hi
there!&rdquo; he called to Mr. Woodsmall, who was
preparing to unlock the mail box, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
it,&rdquo; and he sprinted down the walk where the garrulous
postman held him enthralled for a good
fifteen minutes. A blue envelope with a foreign
postmark told him there was a letter from Julia
Kean that would be eagerly welcomed by Molly,
but there was no stopping the flow of R.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;D.&rsquo;s
eloquence. The causes of the war being thoroughly
threshed out, he finally took his reluctant
departure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A letter from Judy Kean! Now you will have
to put the baby down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So little Mildred was tenderly placed in her
basket on the porch and Molly opened the voluminous
epistle from the beloved Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Edwin, she is not coming home! I was
afraid she would want to do something Judyesque.
Only listen!&rdquo; and Molly read the Giverny
letter to her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think Kent will say to this? I
know he is very uneasy about her anyhow since
the war broke out, and now&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m
not in his shoes. She is not very considerate of
him, I must say.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you men folks!&rdquo; laughed Molly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
see how she could leave France until she knows
something about her mother and father, and after
all, I don&rsquo;t believe Kent and Judy are engaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not engaged! What do you think Kent has
been doing this whole year in Paris if he wasn&rsquo;t
getting engaged?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Studying Architecture at the Beaux Arts.
Sometimes persons can know one another a long
time and be together a lot and not get engaged,&rdquo;
she teased. It was a very well-known fact that
Professor Edwin Green had been in love with
Molly Brown for at least five years, and maybe
longer, before he put the all important question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, but then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what? My brother Kent is certainly
not able to support a wife yet, and maybe they
are opposed to long engagements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all the same I am sorry for Kent. It
was bad enough when you went abroad and the
ocean was between us and I knew you were being
well taken care of by your dear mother,&mdash;but just
suppose it had been war time and you had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
alone! The news from France is very grave.
It looks as though the Germans would eat Christmas
dinner in Paris as they boast they will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Edwin, no!&rdquo; and Molly turned pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, look at these head lines in to-day&rsquo;s paper.
It looks very ominous. When did you say
you were expecting Kent home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By to-morrow at latest. He wrote Mother
he was to stay some time in New York to try
to land a job that looked very promising.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here she comes now!&rdquo; he exclaimed, his face
lighting up with joy as it always did when his
mother-in-law appeared on the scene.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown was coming through the orchard
from Chatsworth. Her hair had turned a little
greyer since Molly&rsquo;s marriage, but not much;
her step was still light and active; her grey eyes
as full of life; and in her heart the same eternal
youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, children! Did you get any mail? How
is my precious little granddaughter? I&rsquo;ve a letter
from Kent. It just did beat him home. Paul
&rsquo;phoned from Louisville that he is in town now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
just arrived and will be here with him this afternoon.
I am so excited!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dear Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s life was made up of such
excitements now: her children always going and
returning. Mildred, Mrs. Crittenden Rutledge,
had left for Iowa only two days before, having
spent two months with her little family at Chatsworth;
now Kent was almost home; and in less
than a month the Greens would make their annual
move to Wellington. Sue, the eldest daughter,
married to young Cyrus Clay, lived within a
few miles of Chatsworth and seemed the only
one who was a fixture. Paul&rsquo;s newspaper work
kept him in Louisville most of the time and John,
the doctor, made flying visits to his home but
had to make his headquarters in the city for fear
of missing patients. Ernest, the eldest son, was
threatening to come home and settle at Chatsworth,
but that was still an uncertainty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must read you Judy&rsquo;s letter, Mother. I
know you will feel as uneasy as we do about her.
Edwin thinks she should come home, but I think
she could hardly leave, not knowing something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
more definite about her mother and father, who
may be bottled up in Germany indefinitely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only think of the sizzle Mr. Kean will make
when they finally draw the cork,&rdquo; laughed
Mrs. Brown; but when Molly read the
whole of Judy&rsquo;s letter to her, the laughter
left her countenance and she looked very solemn
and disturbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Kent!&rdquo; she sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what he will do,&rdquo; from Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do? Why, he will do what the men of his
blood should do!&rdquo; Mrs. Brown held her head
very high and her delicate nostrils quivered in
the way her family knew meant either anger or
high resolve. &ldquo;He will go to France and either
stay and protect Judy or bring her back to his
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mother, are you going to ask this of
him? Maybe he won&rsquo;t think it is the right thing
to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I am not going to ask it of him.
I just know the &lsquo;mettle of his pasture.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the expense!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Expense! Molly, you don&rsquo;t sound like yourself.
What is expense when your loved ones are
in danger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t think that Judy could be in real
danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think anything else. You surely have
not read the morning paper. The Germans are
advancing so rapidly.... The atrocities in Belgium!
Ugh! I can&rsquo;t contemplate our Judy being
anywhere in their reach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mother, they must be exaggerated! People
could not do what they say they have done,
not good, kind German soldiers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly! Molly! Your goodness will even let
you love the Germans. I am not made that way.
The Anglo Saxon in me is so uppermost and I
feel such a boiling and bubbling in my veins that
nothing but my grey hairs keeps me from joining
the Red Cross myself and helping the Allies!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then you don&rsquo;t blame Miss Judy
Kean,&rdquo; laughed Professor Green, who never
loved his mother-in-law more than when, as old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Aunt Mary expressed it, &ldquo;her nose was a-wuckin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blame her! No, indeed! If I were her age,
I&rsquo;d do exactly what she is doing, but I should
certainly have expected Molly&rsquo;s father to come
over and protect me while I was being so foolhardy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judy doesn&rsquo;t say she is going as a nurse,&rdquo; said
Molly, referring to the letter. &ldquo;Jo Williams is
to fly and Judy seems uncertain what she is going
to do,&mdash;just see the fight, as far as I can
make out. I know Judy so well I just can&rsquo;t feel
uneasy about her. You mustn&rsquo;t think I am mercenary,
Mother, or careless of my friend. Judy
always lands on her feet and is as much of an
adept in getting out of scrapes as she is in getting
in them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My darling, of course I didn&rsquo;t mean you were
mercenary,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Brown, seeing in Molly&rsquo;s
blue eyes a little hurt look at the vigorous tone
she had taken when Molly merely suggested expense.
&ldquo;I just think in your desire to think well
of every one, nations as well as individuals, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
you are blind to the terrors of this war. If Judy
will only go to Sally Bolling, she will be taken
care of. I fancy Sally is at La Roche Craie
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I had forgotten to think of what this
must mean to Cousin Sally!&rdquo; exclaimed Molly.
&ldquo;The truth of the matter is that it is so peaceful
here my imagination cannot picture what it is
over there. I am growing selfish with contentment.
Of course Philippe d&rsquo;Ochtè will join his
regiment and poor Cousin Sally and the Marquis
will suffer agonies over him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes and over France!&rdquo; said Edwin solemnly.
&ldquo;I remember so well a conversation I had with
the Marquis d&rsquo;Ochtè on the subject of his country.
I believe he really and truly puts his country
above even his adored wife and son. That
is more patriotism than I could be capable
of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it, my dear Edwin,&rdquo; broke in Mrs.
Brown.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;I could not love thee half so well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loved I not honour more.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Molly and your little baby Mildred are but a
part of your country, and if the time should come
and your country called you, you would answer
the call just as I hope my own sons would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother, you are a Spartan! I am not
so brave, I am afraid,&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;Even now
at the thought of war, I am thanking God my
Mildred baby is a girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Mildred, at mention of her name, although
it would be many a day before she would
know what her name was, awakened and gave an
inarticulate gurgle. Mrs. Brown dropped the
rôle of Spartan Mother and turned into a doting
grandmother in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And was um little tootsie wootsies cold?
Come to your Granny and let her warm them.
Molly, this baby has grown a foot, I do believe,
and look what a fine, strong, straight back she
has! And does oo want your Granny to rub
your back? Only look, her eyes have brown lights
in them! I said all the time she would have brown
eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And not Molly&rsquo;s blue eyes! Oh, Mother, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
is very bad news to me. Why, the baby&rsquo;s eyes are
as blue as the sea now. They could not change,&rdquo;
and Edwin Green peered into his offspring&rsquo;s face
with such intentness that the little thing began
to whimper.</p>

<p>The proper indignation being expressed by the
females and the baby dangled until smiles came
and a crow, Mrs. Brown informed the ignorant
father that all young animals have blue eyes and
there is no determining the actual colour of a
baby&rsquo;s eyes until it is several months old, but that
the minute brown or golden lights begin to appear
in blue eyes, you can get ready to declare
for a brown-eyed youngster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she will surely have Molly&rsquo;s hair,&rdquo; he
insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That we can&rsquo;t tell, either,&rdquo; said the all-knowing
grandmother. &ldquo;You see, she is almost bald
now except for this tiny fringe that is rapidly
being worn off in the back. That does seem a
little pinkish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pinkish! Oh, Mother-in-law, what a word to
express my Molly&rsquo;s hair!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see she is getting even with you
for making Mildred almost cry?&rdquo; laughed Molly.
&ldquo;I know she is going to have my hair because
when you slip a little bit of blue under that little
lock that is on the side, where it hasn&rsquo;t rubbed
off, the &lsquo;pink&rsquo; comes out quite plainly. My Mildred
will be a belle. I have always heard it said
that a girl with brown eyes and golden hair is
born to be a belle. Oh, yes, I will call the baby&rsquo;s
hair golden although I have always called my
own red.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I want her to be a belle
or not,&rdquo; objected Edwin. &ldquo;She might be frivolous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frivolous with your eyes! Heavens, Daddy,
she couldn&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown contentedly smiled and rocked the
baby, who crowed and cooed and kicked her
pretty pink tootsies. The sun shone on the orchard
home and a particularly obliging mocking
bird burst into song from one of the gnarled old
apple trees, heavy with its luscious fruit. Mocking
birds are supposed not to sing in August, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
sometimes they do, and when they do, their song
is as wonderful and welcome as an unlooked-for
legacy.</p>

<p>Molly looked over the fields of waving blue
grass to the dark beech woods that bordered the
pasture, a feeling of great happiness and contentment
in her heart. How peaceful and sweet was
life! She leaned against her husband, who put
an ever-ready arm around her, and together they
gazed on the fruitful landscape. Mrs. Brown
crooned to the baby a song ever dear to her own
children and one that had been sung to her by her
own negro mammy.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>How could whole countries be at war and such
peace reign in any spot on the globe?</p>

<p>The whirr of an approaching motor awoke
them from their musings and stopped the delightful
song before one-third of the stanzas had been
sung. It was Kent with John in the doctor&rsquo;s little
runabout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My boy! my boy!&rdquo; and Mrs. Brown dropped
the baby in her basket and flew across the grass
to greet the long-absent Kent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t wait for Paul but had to get old Dr.
John to bring me out. Mumsy, how plump and
pink you are. I declare you look almost as young
as the new baby,&rdquo; said Kent after the first raptures
of greeting were over. &ldquo;And Molly, you
look great! And &rsquo;Fessor Green, I declare you are
getting fat. I bet you have gained at least three-quarters
of a pound since you got married. Positively
obese!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t said much about the baby,&rdquo; objected
Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s not much to say, is there? She
is an omnivorous biped, I gather, from the two
feet I can see and her evident endeavor to eat
them, at least, I fancy that is why she is kicking
so high. She has got Edwin&rsquo;s er&mdash;er&mdash;well&mdash;his
high forehead&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is not nearly so bald-headed as you were
yourself,&rdquo; declared his mother. &ldquo;You were such
a lovely baby, Kent, the loveliest of all my babies,
I believe. I always adored a bald-headed
baby and you had a head like a little billiard ball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all laughed at this and Kent confessed
that if he had been bald-headed himself, he believed
the little Mildred must be, after all, very
charming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any letters for me?&rdquo; he asked, and Molly
thought she detected a note of anxiety below all
the nonsense he had been talking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I have not seen any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, have you heard from&mdash;from Judy
Kean?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; confessed Molly. &ldquo;I got a letter to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please may I see it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course you may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Molly felt a great reluctance to show
Julia Kean&rsquo;s letter to her brother. She knew very
well he was uneasy already about their friend
and was certain this letter would only heighten
his concern. Kent was looking brown and
sturdy; he seemed to her to have grown even
taller than the six feet one he already measured
when he went abroad. His boyish countenance
had taken on more purpose and his jaw had an
added squareness. His deep set grey eyes had a
slight cloud in them that Molly and her mother
hated to see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Judy, of course,&rdquo; they said to themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I landed my job in New York,&rdquo; he said, as he
opened the little blue envelope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; exclaimed Molly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown tried to say splendid, too, but the
thought came to her: &ldquo;Another one going away
from home!&rdquo; and she could only put her arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
around her boy&rsquo;s neck and press a kiss on his
brown head.</p>

<p>They were all very quiet while Kent read the
letter. Dr. John, alone, seemed disinterested.
He very professionally poked the infant in the
ribs to see how fat she had grown and, also, much
to the indignation of Molly, went through some
tests for idiocy, which, of course, the tiny baby
could not pass.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>KENT BROWN.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Mother, will you come and take a little walk
with me?&rdquo; asked Kent as he finished Judy&rsquo;s letter.
With his hand trembling, although his eyes
were very steady and his mouth very firm, he
tucked the many thin blue sheets back in their
envelope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my son!&rdquo; Mrs. Brown held her head very
high and in her expression one could very well
read: &ldquo;I told you so! Did I not know the &lsquo;mettle
of his pasture&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, as he drew her arm in his
and they took their way through the orchard to
the garden of Chatsworth, &ldquo;I must go get Judy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my son, of course you must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother, you think it is the only thing to
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I know it is the only thing to do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
I told Molly and Edwin only a few minutes ago
that you would want to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what a mother! I&mdash;well, you know,
Mother, I am not engaged to Judy&mdash;not exactly,
that is. She knows how I feel about her and
somehow&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say for sure&mdash;but I almost
know she feels the same way about me, at least,
feels somehow about me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she does! How could she help it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, I knew it would be some time before
I could make a decent living, and it did not seem
fair to Judy to tie her down when maybe she
might strike some fellow who would be so much
more worth while than I am&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used to think maybe Pierce Kinsella would
be her choice, when they painted together so
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That boy! Why, Kent, how could you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he was a very handsome and brilliant
boy and is pretty well fixed by his uncle&rsquo;s generosity
and bids fair to make one of the leading
portrait painters of the day. His portrait of you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
has made every lady who has seen it want him to
do one of her. Of course, he can&rsquo;t make all of
&rsquo;em look like you, but he does his best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may have been wise of you not to settle this
little matter with Judy, son, but somehow&mdash;I
wish you had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was hard not to, but I felt she was so far
away from her parents. I thought she would be
back in America in a month, at least. I wanted
her to come with me, but she felt she must wait
for them, and of course, I had to hurry back because
of the possible job in New York. I am
afraid that I will lose that now, but there will be
others, and I just can&rsquo;t think of the things that
might happen to my Judy&mdash;she is my Judy,
whether we are engaged or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When will you start, son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, to-night, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly to-night! I have money for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother, the money part is the only thing
worrying me. I have a little left, but not enough
to get me over and back. I must have enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
bring Judy back, too. You see, a letter of credit
now in Paris is not worth the paper it is on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I did not know. That is the one part of
Judy&rsquo;s letter that put me at ease about her. I
thought she had plenty of money, and money certainly
does help out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that is the part of her letter that made
me know I must go get her. The Americans who
are abroad simply can&rsquo;t get checks cashed. She
might even be hungry, poor little Judy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness, I have some money&mdash;all
owing to Judy&rsquo;s father, too! If he had not seen
the bubbles on that puddle in the rocky pasture,
we would never have known there was oil there.
What better could we do with the money that Mr.
Kean got for us than use it to succor his
daughter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother, you are so&mdash;so&mdash;bully! I know
no other word to express what you are. I am
going to pay back every cent I borrow from you.
Thank goodness, I saved a little from the money
I made on the architectural sketches I did for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
article Dickson wrote on the French country
homes. I&rsquo;m going over steerage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going over in the first class cabin!
Steerage, indeed! I lend no money for such a
trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Mother! You are the boss. And
now, don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;ll have time to go see Aunt
Mary a few minutes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you must go see the poor old
woman. She has been afraid she would not live
until you got home. She is very feeble. Dear
old Aunt Mary!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had reached the Chatsworth garden and
Kent noticed with delight the hollyhocks that had
flourished wonderfully since he had dug them up
that moonlight night more than three years ago
and transplanted them from the chicken yard,
where no one ever saw them, to the beds in the
garden, and all because Miss Julia Kean had regretted
that they were not there to make a background
for the bridal party, after they had determined
to have Mildred&rsquo;s wedding out of
doors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t they come on wonderfully? I know
Judy would like to see how well they have done.
I think hollyhocks are the most decorative of all
flowers. I wonder we never had them in the garden
before, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both of them were thinking of Mildred&rsquo;s wedding
on that rare day in June. Kent remembered
with some satisfaction that in the general confusion
that ensued after Mildred and Crit were pronounced,
by Dr. Peters, to be man and wife, and
everybody was kissing everybody else, he had had
presence of mind to take advantage of the license
accorded on the occasion of a family wedding
and had kissed his sister Molly&rsquo;s college friend,
Miss Julia Kean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove! I think war ought to give a fellow
some privilege, too,&rdquo; he declared to himself. &ldquo;I
think I&rsquo;ll do the same when I see the young lady
in France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They found Aunt Mary lying in state in a
great four poster bed, while her meek half-sister,
Sukey Jourdan, administered to her wants, which
were many and frequent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Lawsamussy, if that ain&rsquo;t that there Kent!
Whar you come from, son? I done got so old an&rsquo;
feeble I can&rsquo;t say mister ter nobody. You alls is
all Ernest and Sue and Paul and John and Mildred
and Kent and Molly ter me. Cepn Molly is
Molly Baby. I still got strenth fer that. Law,
Miss Milly, ain&rsquo;t he growed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Aunt Mary, he is looking so well, and
now he is going to turn right around and go back
to France to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it! Lawsamussy, Miss Milly, did
he fergit somethin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly,&rdquo; laughed Kent, &ldquo;but I
didn&rsquo;t bring something with me that I should
have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you be sho ter make a cross an&rsquo; spit in
it. If&rsquo;n you fergits somethin&rsquo; er fin&rsquo;s you has ter
tu&rsquo;n aroun&rsquo; an&rsquo; go back &rsquo;thout res&rsquo;in&rsquo; a piece, if&rsquo;n
you makes a cross an&rsquo; spits in it, you is sho ter
have good luck. Here you, Sukey, set a better
cheer for Miss Milly. Wherfo&rsquo; you done give
her sich a straight up&rsquo;n down cheer?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, this will do very well, Sukey,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Brown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bring another, Sukey. I don&rsquo; see what
makes you so keerless. I low if&rsquo;n &rsquo;twar that no
count Buck Jourdan, you&rsquo;d be drawin&rsquo; up the sofy
fer his triflin&rsquo; bones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Sukey had no easy job to keep Aunt Mary
satisfied. The old woman, having been a most
energetic and tireless person in her day, could not
understand that the whole world of darkeys could
not be as she had been. Sukey&rsquo;s son Buck, the
apple of her mild eye, was the bane of Aunt
Mary&rsquo;s existence. She never missed a chance to
make her younger half-sister miserable on his
account. Indeed, Sukey, mild as she was, would
not have stayed with Aunt Mary except for the
fact that Aunt Mary had insured her life for her
with the understanding that she was to minister
to her to the end. It was dearly paid for, this
service, as the old woman was most exacting.
Lenient to a degree of softness with white folks,
she was adamant with those of her own race.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you feel, Aunt Mary?&rdquo; asked Kent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
looking with sorrow on the wasted features of the
beloved old woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m a feelin&rsquo; tolerable peart this mornin&rsquo;
although endurin&rsquo; of the night I thought my hour
had struck. I got ter dreamin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout my fun&rsquo;ral,
an&rsquo; I got so mad cause Sis Ria Bowles done
brought a fun&rsquo;ral zine like one she done tuck ter
Brer Jackson&rsquo;s orgies! An&rsquo; dead or not, I wa&rsquo;nt
gonter stan&rsquo; fer no sich monkey shines over me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what did she take to Brother Jackson&rsquo;s
funeral?&rdquo; laughed Kent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you heard tel er that? She cut a cross
outn that there sticky tangle yo&rsquo; foot fly paper en&rsquo;
she kivered it all over with daisy haids an&rsquo; call
herse&rsquo;f bringing a zine. I riz up an&rsquo; spoke my
mind in my dream an&rsquo; I let all these here niggers
in Jeff&rsquo;son County know that if they
don&rsquo;t see that I gits a fust class fun&rsquo;ral, I gonter
rise up when I ain&rsquo;t a dreamin&rsquo; an&rsquo; speak
my min&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sukey Jourdan listened to this tirade with her
eyes bulging out of her head, much to Aunt
Mary&rsquo;s satisfaction, as she very well knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the way to manage her race was to intimidate
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I done been carryin&rsquo; insuriance in two clubs
an&rsquo; a comp&rsquo;ny, an&rsquo; betwixt &rsquo;em I&rsquo;s entitled ter seventeen
hacks. I&rsquo;m a trustin&rsquo; ter Miss Milly an&rsquo;
that there Paul ter make &rsquo;em treat me proper.
Paul done say he will black list &rsquo;em in his newspaper
if&rsquo;n they leave off one tit or jottle from the
&rsquo;greement. I sho would like ter see my fun&rsquo;ral.
I low it&rsquo;s a goin&rsquo; ter be pretty stylish. I done
pinted my pall buriers an&rsquo; bought they gloves an&rsquo;
I low ter be laid out myself in my best black silk
what Miss Milly done gimme goin&rsquo; on sixteen
year, come nex&rsquo; Christmas. I ain&rsquo;t a wo&rsquo; it much,
as I had in min&rsquo; ter save it fer my buryin&rsquo;. Some
of the mimbers gits buried in palls made er white
silk. They do look right han&rsquo;some laid out in
&rsquo;em, but then palls is made &rsquo;thout a piece er back
an&rsquo; I has a notion that when Gabrel blows his
trump on that great an&rsquo; turrerble day that ole
Mary Morton ain&rsquo;t a goin&rsquo; ter be caught without
no back ter her grabe clothes. It mought make
no diffrunce if&rsquo;n Peter will let me pass on in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
&rsquo;cause I low that the shining robes will be a
waitin&rsquo; fer me&mdash;but sposin&rsquo;&mdash;jes&rsquo; sposin&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
and the dear old woman&rsquo;s face clouded over with
anguish, &ldquo;jes&rsquo; sposin&rsquo; Peter&rsquo;ll say: &lsquo;You, Mary
Morton, g&rsquo;long from this here portcullis. You
blongs in the tother d&rsquo;rection,&rsquo; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll hab ter tun
&rsquo;roun&rsquo; an&rsquo; take the broad road ter hell! What&rsquo;ll I
feel like, if&rsquo;n I ain&rsquo;t got no back ter my frock?
No, sir! I&rsquo;s a goin&rsquo; ter have on a dress complete.
It mought be that Peter&rsquo;ll think better er me if I
shows him sech a spectful back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You not get in Heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed Kent.
&ldquo;Why, Aunt Mary, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any Heaven
for all of us bad Brown boys if you weren&rsquo;t
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now them is words of comfort what
beats the preacher&rsquo;s. I done always been b&rsquo;lievin&rsquo;
in &rsquo;fluence an&rsquo; I mought er knowed my white
folks would look arfter me on the las&rsquo; day jes as
much as ever. I kin git in as Miss Milly&rsquo;s cook
if&rsquo;n th&rsquo;aint no other way. I been a &rsquo;lowing whin
I gits ter Heaven I wouldn&rsquo;t have ter work no
more, but sence I been a laid up in the baid so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
long I gin ter think that work would tas&rsquo;e
right sweet. Cookin&rsquo; in Heaven wouldn&rsquo;t be so
hard with plenty of &rsquo;gredients ter han&rsquo; and no
scrimpin&rsquo; and scrougin&rsquo; of &rsquo;terials. A lan&rsquo;
flowin&rsquo; with milk an&rsquo; honey mus&rsquo; have aigs an&rsquo;
butter. Here you, Sukey Jourdan! Whar
you hidin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I is, Sis Ma&rsquo;y, I jes&rsquo; stepped in the shed
room ter men&rsquo; the fire ginst &rsquo;twas time ter knock
up a bite er dinner fer you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, while I&rsquo;s a thinkin&rsquo; of it, I want you to
git my bes&rsquo; linen apron outn the chist&mdash;the one
with the insertioning let in &rsquo;bove the hem, an&rsquo; put
it in the highboy drawer with my bes&rsquo; black silk.
I low I&rsquo;ll be laid out in a apron, &rsquo;cause if&rsquo;n I can&rsquo;t
git inter Heaven no other way, I am a thinkin&rsquo;
with a clean white apron on I kin slip in as a good
cook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Aunt Mary, you have been as good as
gold all your life,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Brown, wiping
a tear from her eye, but smiling in spite of herself
at Aunt Mary&rsquo;s quaint idea of a way to gain an
entrance through the pearly gates.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Aunt Mary had had many doubts about her being
saved and had spent many weary nights, terrified
at the thought of dying and perhaps not being
fit for Heaven, but now that she had thought of
wearing the apron, all doubts of her desirability
were set at rest; indeed, her last days were filled
with peace since she felt now that even Peter
could not turn back a good cook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be going, Aunt Mary,&rdquo; said Kent, taking
the old woman&rsquo;s withered hand in his strong
grasp. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be home again in a few weeks, I
fancy, maybe sooner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;s one thing I ain&rsquo;t arsked you yit: whar&rsquo;s
that there Judy gal? I been a dreamin&rsquo; you
would bring her back with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is the thing I am going back to France
for, Aunt Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sho nuf? Well, well! They do tell me
they&rsquo;s fightin&rsquo; goin&rsquo; on in some er them furren
parts. Sholy Miss Judy ain&rsquo;t nigh the fightin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; fussin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am afraid she is. That&rsquo;s the reason I
must go for her.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Kent son! Don&rsquo;t you git into no scrap
yo&rsquo;sef. It&rsquo;s moughty hard fer young folks ter
look on at a scrap &rsquo;thout gittin&rsquo; mixed up in it.
Don&rsquo;t you git too clost, whin you is lookin&rsquo;, either.
Them what looks on sometimes gits the deepes&rsquo;
razor cuts with the back han&rsquo; licks. You pick up
that gal an&rsquo; bring her back ter you&rsquo; maw jes&rsquo; as
fas&rsquo; as yo&rsquo; legs kin carry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to,&rdquo; laughed Kent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try! Jes&rsquo; do it! That there Judy gal
is sho nice an&rsquo; &rsquo;ristocratic, considerin&rsquo; she ain&rsquo;t
never had no home. She done tell me whin she
was here to little Miss Milly&rsquo;s weddin&rsquo; that she
an&rsquo; her folks ain&rsquo;t never lived in nothin&rsquo; but
rented houses. That&rsquo;s moughty queer to me, but
&rsquo;cose niggers don&rsquo;t understan&rsquo; ev&rsquo;y thing. Well,
you tell her that ole Mary Morton say she better
pick up an&rsquo; come back to Chatswuth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly will, Aunt Mary, and good-by!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman put her hand on his bowed
head for a moment, and while she said nothing,
Kent took it for a benediction.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>AFTERNOON TEA.</small></h2>


<p>Molly had established the custom of afternoon
tea in her orchard home, and while she had been
greatly teased by her brothers for introducing
this English custom into Kentucky country life,
they one and all turned up on her porch for tea if
they were in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is one place where a fellow can always find
some talk and a place to air his views,&rdquo; declared
John, as he reached for another slice of bread and
butter. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the food so much as the being
gathered together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you are gathering a good deal of food
together in spite of your contempt for it,&rdquo; put in
Paul. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sixth slice! I have kept tab
on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? I always think plain bread and
butter is about the best thing there is.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, why not?&rdquo; asked Molly, calling her little
cook Kizzie to prepare another plate of the desirable
article. &ldquo;Aunt Clay, you had better change
your mind and have some tea and bread and
butter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Sarah Clay had driven over in state from
her home when she heard Kent had arrived. She
wanted to hear the latest news, also to tender her
advice as to what he was to do now. She presented
the same uncompromising front as of yore,
although her back had given way somewhat to
the weight of years. Judy Kean always said she
had a hard face and a soft figure. This soft figure
she poured into tight basques, evidently determined
to try to make it live up to her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tea!&rdquo; she exclaimed indignantly. &ldquo;I never
eat between meals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this is a meal, in a way,&rdquo; said Molly hospitably
bent, as was her wont, on feeding people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A meal! Whoever heard of tea and bread
and butter comprising a meal?&rdquo; and the stern
aunt stalked to the end of the porch where the
baby lay in her basket, kicking her pink heels in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the air in an ecstasy of joy over being in the
world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly, this baby has on too few clothes.
What can you be thinking of, having the child
barefooted and nothing on but this muslin slip
over her arms? She is positively blue with
cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly flew to her darling but found her glowing
and warm. &ldquo;Why, Aunt Clay, only feel her
hands and feet! She is as warm as toast. The
doctor cautioned me against wrapping her up too
much. He says little babies are much warmer
than we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, have your own way! Of course, although
I am older than your mother, I know
nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Aunt Clay&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Molly! She could never do or say anything
to suit her Aunt Clay. She looked regretfully
at the old lady&rsquo;s indignant back as she left
her and joined Kent, who was sitting on a settle
with his mother, holding her hand, both of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
very quiet amidst the chatter around the tea table.
They made room for their relative, who
immediately began her catechism of Kent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you not come home sooner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I had some work to do, sketches illustrating
an article on French country houses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! Did you get paid for them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Aunt Clay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what are your plans?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have landed a job in New York with a firm
of architects, that is, I had landed it, but I am not
so sure now since&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! You feel that you had better stay at
home and look after Chatsworth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! I am sure I could not be much of a
farmer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could not because you would not! If I were
your mother, I would insist on one of you staying
at home and running the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ernest is thinking of coming back, giving up
engineering and trying intensive farming on
Chatsworth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ernest, indeed! And why should he have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
wasted all these years in some other profession
if he means to farm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; said Kent very patiently because
of the pressure he felt from his mother&rsquo;s
gentle hand, &ldquo;farming takes money and there
wasn&rsquo;t any money. Ernest always did want to
farm, but it was necessary for him to make some
money first. Now he has saved and invested and
has something to put in the land, and he is
devoutly hoping to get out more than he
puts in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If putting something in the land means expensive
machinery, I can tell him now that he
will waste money buying it. But there is no use
in telling Ernest anything&mdash;he is exactly like
Sue: very quiet, does not answer back when his
elders and betters address him, but, like Sue, goes
his own way. Sue is very headstrong and simply
twists my husband&rsquo;s nephew around her finger.
I was very much disappointed in Cyrus
Clay. I thought he had more backbone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sue Brown, now Mrs. Cyrus Clay, had been
the one member of the Brown family who always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
got on with the stern Aunt Clay; and Kent and
his mother were sorry to hear the old lady express
any criticism of Sue. It seemed that Sue
had done nothing more serious than to persuade
Cyrus to join the Country Club, but it was
against Mrs. Sarah Clay&rsquo;s wishes, and anything
that opposed her was headstrong and consequently
wicked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But to return to you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Kent let a sigh escape
him as he had hoped he had eluded further
catechism, &ldquo;what are you going to do now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, to-night I go back to New York, and
day after to-morrow I take a French steamer for
Havre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Havre! Are you crazy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do in France with this
war going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not quite sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was too much for the irate old lady, so
without making any adieux, she took her departure,
scorning the polite assistance of her three
nephews. Professor Green called her coachman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and helped her into the great carriage she still
held to, the kind seen now-a-days only in
museums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kent, how could you?&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Brown,
in spite of her attempt to look shocked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Kent was right,&rdquo; declared Molly.
&ldquo;How could he tell Aunt Clay he was going to
France to get Judy? She would never have let
up on it. I&rsquo;m glad she has gone, anyhow! We
were having a very nice time without her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly!&rdquo; and Mrs. Brown looked shocked.
She always exacted a show of respect from her
children to this very difficult elder sister Sarah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mumsy, we have to break loose sometimes!&rdquo;
exclaimed Molly. &ldquo;The idea of her saying
Mildred was blue with cold! Criticising poor
Sue, too! Goodness, I&rsquo;d hate to be the one that
Aunt Clay had taken a shine to. I&rsquo;d almost
rather have her despise me as she does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not despise you, Molly,&mdash;you don&rsquo;t understand
your Aunt Clay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps not, but she puts up a mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
good imitation of despising. I think it is because
I look so like Cousin Sally Bolling and she never
forgave the present Marquise d&rsquo;Ochtè for making
fun of her long years ago. And then to
crown it all, Cousin Sally got the inheritance
from Greataunt Sarah Carmichael and married
the Marquis, at least she married the Marquis
and then got the inheritance. It was too much
for Aunt Clay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown looked so pained that Molly
stopped her tirade. Aunt Clay was the one person
whom Molly could not love. She had a heart
as big as all out doors but it was not big enough
to hold Aunt Clay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes Sue! How glad I am! She
&rsquo;phoned she would be here before so very long.
What a blessing she missed Aunt Clay! See, she
is running the car herself and isn&rsquo;t it a beauty?
Cyrus just got it for her and Sue runs it wonderfully
well already. I forgot to write you about
it, Kent. But best of all! What do you think?
Cyrus has had the muddy lane that was the cause
of Sue&rsquo;s hesitating whether to take him or not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
all drained and macadamized. The approach to
Maxton is simply perfect now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for Cyrus!&rdquo; said Kent, jumping up to
meet his sister, who drove her big car through the
gate and up the driveway as though she had been
running an automobile all her life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only think, five Browns together again!&rdquo; exclaimed
Paul, as they seated themselves on the
porch of the bungalow after duly admiring the
new car. Molly had Kizzie brew a fresh pot of
tea and John was persuaded to eat some more
thin slices of bread and butter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, five of you together again,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Brown wistfully. &ldquo;Ah, me! I wish I could get
all seven of you at Chatsworth once more. Indeed,
I wish I had all of you back in the nursery
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where would I come in then?&rdquo; said Edwin
Green whimsically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And little Mildred?&rdquo; from Molly, hugging
her infant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Sue&rsquo;s new car, not to mention Cyrus?&rdquo;
teased Kent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right, children. I should be more of
a philosopher.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;The Moving Finger writes: and, having writ,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Molly stood over Kent with a cup of steaming
tea and taking her cue from her mother&rsquo;s quotation
from the Rubaiyat and prompted by his
knownothing attitude with his Aunt Clay, she got
off the stanza:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>LETTERS FROM PARIS AND BERLIN.</small></h2>


<p>From Miss Julia Kean to Mrs. Edwin Green.</p>

<p class="right">
Paris, and no idea of the date.<br />
No fixed address, but the American<br />
Club might reach me.<br />
</p>

<p>Molly darling:</p>

<p>Things are moving so fast that even I can&rsquo;t
quite catch on, and you know I am some mover
myself. Jo and I came to Paris as I wrote you
we would, but I haven&rsquo;t seen her since. She told
me in as polite words as she could command that
she couldn&rsquo;t be bothered with me any more. At
least that was the trend of her remarks. She has
the business before her of making up to look as
much like a man as possible and then of being
taken into the aviation school.</p>

<p>I met an art student from Carlo Rossi&rsquo;s on the
street and he told me Polly was already the proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
driver of an ambulance. Lots of the American
art students have enlisted or joined the Red
Cross. If I liked sick folks or nursing, I think
I&rsquo;d join myself. I feel that I should be doing
something while I wait to hear from Bobby. I
hope to see the American Ambassador next week.
He is simply floored under with duties just now.
I don&rsquo;t want any help from him, but just to find
out something about Bobby and Mamma.</p>

<p>If you could see Paris now! Oh, Molly, our
gay, beautiful, eternally youthful city has grown
suddenly sad and middle-aged. There is no
gaiety or frivolity now. Her step has changed
from a dance to a march. Her laughter has
turned to weeping, but silent weeping&mdash;she makes
no outcry but one knows the tears are there.
Her beautiful festive clothes are laid away and
now there is nothing but khaki and mourning.
The gallant little soldier is to discard his flaming
red trousers and blue coat for khaki. The German
finds him too easy a mark.</p>

<p>I begin to tremble for Paris, but strange to say
I have no fear for myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>I have seen the Ambassador! He was very
grave when I told him about Bobby. There was
some English capital involved in the railroad that
Bobby was to build in Turkey, and for that reason
there may be some complication. He is to
communicate with Gerard immediately. In the
meantime, he advises me to go home. I told him
I had no home, but would wait here until I found
out something. He asked me if I had plenty of
money and I told him yes, indeed, my letter of
credit was good for almost any amount. I had
not had to draw on it as I had stocked up before
I went to G&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;to keep house with the Polly
Perkinses. The Ambassador actually laughed at
me. Do you know, I can&rsquo;t get any more money?
What a fool I have been! I have been so taken
up with Paris and the sights and sounds that
money has never entered my head. I have quite
a little left, though, and I intend to live on next
to nothing.</p>

<p>The Bents have left for America and have
given me their key to use their studio as I see fit.
Mrs. Bent wanted me to go with them, but I can&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
go until we hear from Gerard. Now I am back
in the Rue Brea! It seems strange to be there
again where we had such a glorious winter. The
studio where Kent and Pierce Kinsella lived all
last year is vacant. I don&rsquo;t know where Pierce
is. Gone to war, perhaps!</p>

<p>I spend the days on the streets, walking up and
down, listening to the talk and watching the regiments
as they move away. I ran across some old
friends yesterday. You remember a wedding
party I butted in on at St. Cloud that day I scared
all of you so when I took the wrong train from
Versailles and landed at Chartres? Well, I ran
plump against the bride on Montparnasse (only
she is no longer a bride but had a rosy infant over
her shoulder). She came out of a little delicatessen
shop and her husband in war togs followed
her, and there I witnessed their parting. I seem
fated to be present at every crisis in their lives.
The girl did not recognize me but the young man
did. I had danced with him in too mad a whirl
for him to forget me. Then came the old father
and his wife who looked like a member of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Commune. They keep the little shop, it seems.
I shook hands with them and together we waited
for the young man&rsquo;s regiment to come swinging
down the street. With another embrace all
around, even me, he caught step with his comrades
and was gone. The bonnemère clasped her
daughter-in-law to her grenadier-like bosom and
they mingled their tears, the rosy baby gasping
for breath between the two. The old father
turned to me:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is different from the last time we met,
ma&rsquo;mselle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, so different!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in and have a bite and sup with us.
There is still something to eat in Paris besides
horse flesh.&rdquo; His wife and daughter-in-law
joined him in the invitation and so I went in. I
enjoyed the meal more than I can tell you. The
grenadier is some cook and although the fare was
simple, it was so well seasoned and appetizing
that I ate as I have not done since I got back to
Paris. The truth of the matter is, I am living
so cheap for fear of getting out of money and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
am afraid I have been neglecting my inner man.
I can&rsquo;t cook a thing myself, which is certainly
trifling of me, and so have depended on restaurants
for sustenance. I dressed the salad (you
remember it is my one accomplishment) and it
met with the approval of host and hostess.</p>

<p>I told them of my trouble and how I felt I must
wait until I heard something definite of my
mother and father, and they were all sympathy.
I have promised to come to them if I get into
difficulty, and you don&rsquo;t know the comfortable
feeling I have now that I have some adopted
folks.</p>

<p>I might go to the Marquise d&rsquo;Ochtè, but I know
she has all on her hands and mind that she can
attend to. I don&rsquo;t need anything but just companionship.
I am such a gregarious animal that
I must have folks.</p>

<p>I am dying to hear from you and to know if
Kent landed his job. Is he&mdash;well, angry with me
for staying over? I would not have missed staying
for anything, even if he should be put out.
I can&rsquo;t believe he is, though. I had rather hoped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
for letters when the American mail came in this
morning, but the man at the bank was very unfeeling
and had nothing. Nobody seems to be
getting any mail. I wonder if they are stopping
it for some reason or other. I have a great mind
to take this to some American who is fleeing and
have it mailed in New York. I will do that very
thing. Good by, Molly&mdash;don&rsquo;t be uneasy about
me. You know my catlike nature of lighting on
my feet.</p>

<p>
<span class="rght3">Your own,</span><br />
<span class="rght1">Judy.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="r3">From Mr. Robert Kean to his Daughter Julia.</p>

<p><span class="rght2">Berlin.</span><br /></p>

<p>My dear Judy:</p>

<p>I know you are intensely uneasy about us, but
down in your heart you also know that we never
get into scrapes we can&rsquo;t get out of, and we will
get out of this. This letter will probably be postmarked
Sweden but that does not mean I am
there. In fact, I am in durance vile here in Berlin.
I am allowed to walk around the streets and
to pay my own living expenses but leave Berlin I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
cannot. Your mother can&rsquo;t leave, either&mdash;not
that she would. You know how she thinks that
she protects me and so she insists that she will
stay. I am allowed to write no letters and can
receive none. I am getting this off to you by a
clever device of your mother&rsquo;s, which I shall not
divulge now for fear it might be seized and thus
get an innocent person in bad with this remarkable
Government.</p>

<p>I am kept here all because I know too much
about the geography and topography of Turkey.
Of course I have made careful maps of the proposed
railroad from Constantinople, the one we
have been trying to get the concessions for.
Well, they have naturally seized the maps. But
before I dreamed of the possibility of this war,
for, like all of us fool Anglo Saxons, I have been
nosing along like a mole, I had a talk with a high
Prussian Muckamuck at dinner one evening
about this proposed road and I drew the blame
thing on the table cloth, and with bits of bread
and salt cellars and what not I explained the
whole topography of the country and the benefit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
it would be to mankind to have this particular
railroad built, financed by my particular company.
That was where I &ldquo;broke my &rsquo;lasses pitcher.&rdquo; Of
course, having surveyed the country and made
the maps, at least, having had a finger in the pie
from the beginning, I can reproduce those maps
from memory, if not very accurately, at least, accurately
enough to get the Germans going if that
particular information should be needed by the
Allies.</p>

<p>Do you know what I see in this? Why, Turkey
will be in this war before so very long.</p>

<p>I am hungry for news. I feel that I will go
mad if I can&rsquo;t get some information besides what
is printed in these boot licking newspapers of
Berlin. They speak of their soldiers as though
they were avenging angels&mdash;avenging what?
Avenging the insult Belgium offered them for not
lying down and making a road of herself for them
to walk over. Avenging France for not opening
wide her gates and getting ready the Christmas
dinner the Kaiser meant to eat in Paris. I&rsquo;d like
to prepare his Christmas dinner, and surely I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
would serve a hors-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre of rough-on-rats, an
entrée of ptomaines, and finish off with a dessert
of hanging, which would be too sweet for him.
Now just suppose this letter is seized and they see
this above remark&mdash;what then? I must not be
allowed to write my opinion of their ruler to my
own daughter, but these Prussians who go to
United States and get all they can from our country,
feel at perfect liberty to publish newspapers
vilifying our President and to burst into print at
any moment about our men who are high in
authority.</p>

<p>Berlin is wild with enthusiasm and joy over her
victories. Every Belgian village that is razed to
the ground makes them think it is cause for a
torch-light procession. I can&rsquo;t understand them.
They can hardly be the same kindly folk we have
so often stayed among. They are still kind, kind
to each other and kind in a way to us and to all
the strangers within their gates, but how they can
rejoice over the reports of their victories I cannot
see.</p>

<p>They one and all believe that they were forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to fight. They say France was marching to Berlin
for the President to eat Christmas dinner
here, and that Belgium had promised they should
go straight through her gates unmolested and
did not regard the agreement of neutrality. I
say nonsense to such statements. At least I
think nonsense. I really say very little for one
who has so much to say. I am bubbling over to
talk politics with some one. Your poor little
mumsy listens to me but she never jaws back. I
want some one to jaw back. I have promised her
to keep off the subject with these Prussians.
They are so violent and so on the lookout for
treason. There is one thing I am sure of and
that is that no Frenchman would want to eat
Christmas dinner or any other kind of dinner
here if he could eat it in Paris. I am sick of raw
goose and blood pudding and Limburger cheese.</p>

<p>As I write this tirade, I am wondering, my dear
daughter, where you are. Did you go back to
America with Kent Brown, who, you wrote me
in your last letter, was sailing in a week, or are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
you in Paris? I hope not there! Since I see the
transports of joy these law-abiding, home-loving
citizens, women and men, can get in over an account
of what seems to me mere massacre, I
tremble to think what the soldiers are capable of
in the lust of bloodshed.</p>

<p>From the last bulletin, the Germans are certainly
coming closer and closer to Paris. I hope
they are lying in their report. They are capable
of falsifying anything.</p>

<p>I am trying to get hold of our Ambassador to
get me out of this mess, but he is so busy it is hard
to see him. I think he is doing excellent work
and I feel it is best for me to wait and let the
Americans who are in more urgent need get first
aid. I have enough money to tide us over for a
few weeks with very careful expenditure. Of
course I can get no more, just like all the rest of,
the Americans who are stranded here.</p>

<p>I feel terribly restless for work. I don&rsquo;t know
how to loaf, never did. I&rsquo;d go to work here at
something, but I feel if I did, it would just mean
that these Prussians could then spare one more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
man for their butchery, and I will at least not
help them that much. Your mother and I are on
the street a great deal. We walk up and down
and go in and out of shops and sit in the parks.
I keep moving as much as possible, not only because
I am so restless but because I like to keep
the stupid spy who is set to watch over me as busy
as possible. He has some weird notion that I do
not know he is ever near me. I keep up the farce
and I give him many anxious moments. Yesterday
I wrote limericks and nonsense verses on letter
paper and made little boats of them and sent
them sailing on the lake in the park. If you
could have seen this man&rsquo;s excitement. He
called in an accomplice and they fished out the
boats and carefully concealing them, they got
hold of a third spy to take them to the chief. I
wonder what they made of:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;The Window has Four little Panes:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But One have I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Window Panes are in its Sash,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I wonder why!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>or this:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;I wish that my Room had a Floor&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I don&rsquo;t so much care for a Door,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But this walking around<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Without touching the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is getting to be quite a bore!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>I only wish I could see the translations of these
foolish rhymes that must have been made before
they could decide whether or not I had a bomb up
my sleeve to put the Kaiser out with. Fancy this
in German:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;The poor benighted Hindoo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He does the best he kindo;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">He sticks to caste<br /></span>
<span class="i6">From first to last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pants he makes his skindo.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Some of the ships sank and they had to get a
boat hook and raise them. My nonsense seems
to have had its effect. I saw in this morning&rsquo;s
paper that some of the foreigners held in Berlin
have gone crazy. I believe they mean me. I
must think up some more foolishness. I feel that
the more I occupy this spy who has me in charge,
the better it is for the Allies. I try to be neutral
but my stomach is rebelling at German food,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and who can be neutral with a prejudiced
stomach?</p>

<p>We are trying to cook in our room. You
know what a wonder your little mumsy is at
knocking up an omelette and making coffee and
what not, and we also find it is much more economical
to eat there all we can. When we are
there, we are out of sight of the spy, who, of
course, can&rsquo;t help his job, but neither can I help
wanting to kick his broad bean. He is such a
block-head. He reminds me of the Mechanician
Man, in our comic papers: &ldquo;Brains he has nix.&rdquo;
He is evidently doing just exactly what he has
been wound up and set to do. I can&rsquo;t quite see
why I should be such an important person that I
should need a whole spy to myself. I can&rsquo;t get
out of Berlin unless I fly out and I see no chance
of that.</p>

<p class="star">*******</p>

<p>I have had my interview with the Ambassador.
He sent for me, and the wonderful thing was
that it was because of the ball you had set rolling
in Paris. When one Ambassador gets in communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
with another Ambassador, even when
it is about as unimportant a thing as I am, there
is something doing immediately. You must have
made a hit, honey, with the powers in France,
they got busy so fast. It seems that the Imperial
Government is very leary about me. My
being an American is the only thing that keeps
me out of prison. They are kind of scared to
put me there, but they won&rsquo;t let me go. I had
to wait an hour even after I got sent for, and
I enjoyed it thoroughly because it was raining
hard and blowing like blazes and I knew that my
bodyguard was having to take it. Indeed I
could see him all the time across the strasse looking
anxiously at the door where he had seen me
disappear. I also had the delight of reading a
two weeks old American newspaper that a very
nice young clerk slipped to me. I suppose the
American Legation gets its newspaper, war or
no.</p>

<p>Nothing can be done for me as yet. I have
been very imprudent in my behaviour, reprehensible,
in fact. The paper boats were most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
ill advised, especially the one that goes: &ldquo;My
Window has Four little Panes.&rdquo; That is something
to do with maps and a signal, it seems.
&ldquo;The Window Panes are in its Sash,&rdquo; is most
suggestive of information. Ah, well! They
can&rsquo;t do more than just keep us here, and if our
money gives out, it will be up to them to feed us.
The time may come when I will be glad to get
even blood pudding, but I can&rsquo;t think it.</p>

<p>Your poor little mumsy, in spite of the years
she has spent with me roughing it, still has a
dainty appetite, and I believe she would as soon
eat a live rat, as blood pudding or raw goose. She
makes out with eggs and salad and coffee and
toast. So far, provisions are plentiful. It is
only our small purse that makes us go easy on
everything. But if the war goes on (which, God
willing, it will do, as a short war will mean the
Germans are victorious), I can&rsquo;t see how provisions
will remain plentiful. What is England
doing, anyhow? She must be doing something,
but she is doing it very slowly.</p>

<p>Your being in Paris is a source of much uneasiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to us, but I can&rsquo;t say that I blame you.
You are too much like me to want to get out
of excitement. I feel sure you will take care
of yourself and now that the French are waltzing
in at such a rate, I have no idea that the
Germans will ever reach Paris. After all, this
letter is to be taken by a lady who is at the
American Legation and mailed to Mrs. Edwin
Green and through her sent to you. They could
not get it directly to you in France, but no doubt
it will finally reach you through your friend,
Molly. I am trusting her to do it and I know
she will do it if any one can, because she is certainly
to be depended on to get her friends out of
trouble. In the meantime, the Ambassador here
is to communicate formally with the Ambassador
in Paris, and he is to let you know that all is
well with your innocent if imprudent parents.
Of course, your mother could go home if she
would, but you know her well enough to know
she won&rsquo;t. In fact, there is some talk of making
her go home, and she says if they start any
such thing she is going to swear she can draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
any map of Turkey that ever was known to
man, and can do it with her eyes shut and her
hands tied behind her.</p>

<p>We both of us wish you were safe in Kentucky
with your friends. We spend many nights
talking of you and reproaching ourselves that we
have left you so much to yourself. I don&rsquo;t see
how we could help it in a way, but maybe I should
have given up engineering and taken up preaching
or been a tailor or something. Then I might
have made a settled habitation for all of us.
Your mumsy is writing you a long letter, too,
so I must stop. She is quite disappointed not
to use her clever scheme for getting the letter
to you, and rather resents the lady at the Legation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>AT THE TRICOTS&rsquo;.</small></h2>


<p>It took one month and three days for Judy
to get the above letter, but her mind was set somewhat
at rest long before that time by the Ambassador
himself, who had learned through his
confrère in Berlin that Mr. and Mrs. Kean were
safe and at large, although not allowed to leave
Berlin.</p>

<p>The daughter was so accustomed to her parents
being in dangerous places that she did not
feel so concerned about them as an ordinary girl
would have felt for ordinary parents. Ever since
she could remember, they had been camping in
out-of-the-way places and making hair-breadth
escapes from mountain wild cats and native uprisings
and what not. She could not believe the
Germans, whom she had always thought of as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
rather bovine, could turn into raging lions so
completely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bobby will light on his feet!&rdquo; she kept saying
to herself until it became almost like a prayer.
&ldquo;No one could hurt Mamma. She will be protected
just as children will be!&rdquo; And then came
terrible, exaggerated accounts of the murder in
cold blood of little children, and then the grim
truth of the destruction of Louvain and Rheims,
and anything seemed possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A nation that could glory in the destruction
of such beautiful things as these cathedrals will
stop at nothing.&rdquo; But still she kept on saying:
&ldquo;Bobby will light on his feet! Bobby will light
on his feet!&rdquo; She no longer trusted the Germans,
but she had infinite faith in the sagacity and
cleverness of her father. He always had got
himself out of difficult and tight places and he
always would.</p>

<p>In the meantime, money was getting very low.
Try as she would to economize, excitement made
her hungry and she must eat and eat three times
a day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If I only had Molly Brown&rsquo;s skill and could
cook for myself!&rdquo; she would groan as she tried
to choke down the muddy concoction that she
had just succeeded in brewing and was endeavoring
to persuade herself tasted a little like coffee.
She remembered with swimming eyes the beautiful
little repasts they had had in the Bents&rsquo; studio
during that memorable winter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judy Kean, you big boob! I believe my soul
you are going to bawl about a small matter of
food. If the destruction of Louvain did not make
you weep, surely muddy coffee ought not to bring
tears to your eyes, unless maybe they are tears
of shame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The truth of the matter was, Judy was lonesome
and idle. She could not make up her mind
to paint. Things were moving too fast and there
was too much reality in the air. Art seemed
unreal and unnecessary, somehow. &ldquo;Great things
will be painted after the war but not now,&rdquo; she
would say. She carried her camera with her
wherever she went and snapped up groups of
women and children, soldiers kissing their old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
fathers, great ladies stopping to converse with
the gamin of the street; anything and everything
went into her camera. She spent more money
on films than on food, in spite of her healthy
hunger.</p>

<p>On that morning in September as she cleared
away the scraps from her meager breakfast, her
eyes swimming from lonesomeness, appetite unappeased
and a kind of nameless longing, she
almost determined to throw herself on the mercy
of the American Legation for funds to return to
New York. The Americans had cleared out of
Paris until there were very few left. Judy would
occasionally see the familiar face of some art
student she had known in the class, but those
familiar faces grew less and less frequent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Marquise! I can always go to
her, but I know she is taken up with her grief
over Philippe&rsquo;s going a soldiering,&rdquo; she thought
as she put her plate and cup back on the shelf
where the Bents kept their assortment of china.</p>

<p>A knock at the door! Who could it be? No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
mail came to her and no friends were left to
come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mam&rsquo;selle!&rdquo; and bowing low before her was
the lean old partner of St. Cloud, Père Tricot.
&ldquo;Mam&rsquo;selle, my good wife and I, as well as our
poor little daughter-in-law, we all want you to
come and make one of our humble menage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want me!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy, her eyes shining.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mam&rsquo;selle,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;We have
talked it over and we think you are too young
to be so much alone and then if&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;well,
I have too much respect for Mam&rsquo;selle to call
their name,&mdash;if they do get in Paris, I can protect
you with my own women. I am not so old
that I cannot hit many a lick yet&mdash;indeed, I would
enlist again if they would have me; but my good
wife says they may need me more here in Paris
and I must rest tranquilly here and do the work
for France that I can best do. Will you come,
Mam&rsquo;selle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come! Oh, Père Tricot, I&rsquo;ll be too glad to
come. When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Immediately!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Judy&rsquo;s valise was soon packed and the studio
carefully locked, the key handed over to the concierge,
and she was arm in arm with her old
friend on her way to her new home in the little
shop on the Boulevarde Montparnasse.</p>

<p>Mère Tricot, who looked like a member of the
Commune but acted like a dear, kindly old Granny,
took the girl to her bosom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you? I knew she would come,&rdquo;
she cried to her husband, who had hurried into
the shop to wait on a customer. It was a delicatessen
shop and very appetizing did the food
look to poor Judy, who felt as though she had
never eaten in her life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo; he exclaimed as he weighed out
cooked spinach to a small child who wanted two
sous&rsquo; worth. &ldquo;Tell me, indeed! You said
Mam&rsquo;selle would not walk on the street with an
old peasant in a faded blouse if she would come
at all, and I&mdash;I said Mam&rsquo;selle was what the
Americans call a good sport and would walk on
the street with an old peasant, if she liked him,
in any kind of clothes he happened to be in, rags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
even. Bah! You were wrong and I was right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old Tricots were forever wrangling but
it was always in a semi-humorous manner, and
their great devotion to each other was always
apparent. Judy found it was better never to
take sides with either one as the moment she did
both of them were against her.</p>

<p>How homelike the little apartment was behind
the shops! It consisted of two bed rooms, a living
room which opened into the shop and a tiny
tiled kitchen about the size of a kitchen on a
dining car&mdash;so tiny that it seemed a miracle that
all the food displayed so appetizingly in the windows
and glass cases of the shop should have
been prepared there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so good of you to have me and I want
to come more than I can say, but you must let me
board with you. I couldn&rsquo;t stay unless you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is as you choose, Mam&rsquo;selle,&rdquo; said the
old woman. &ldquo;We do not want to make money
on you, but you can pay for your keep if you
want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Mother, but I must help some, help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
in the shop or mind the baby, clean up the apartment,
anything! I can&rsquo;t cook a little bit, but I
can do other things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No woman can cook,&rdquo; asserted old Tricot.
&ldquo;They lack the touch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Braggart! If I lay thee out with this
pastry board, I&rsquo;ll not lack the touch,&rdquo; laughed
the wife. She was making wonderful little tarts
with crimped edges to be filled with assortments
of confiture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me mind the shop, then. I know I can
do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that will not be bad,&rdquo; agreed old Tricot.
&ldquo;While Marie (the daughter-in-law) washes the
linen and you make the tarts, Mam&rsquo;selle can keep
the shop, but no board must she pay. I&rsquo;ll be
bound new customers will flock to us to buy of
the pretty face.&rdquo; Judy blushed with pleasure at
the old peasant&rsquo;s compliment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And thou, laggard and sloth! What will thou
do while the women slave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;Oh, I will go to the Tabac&rsquo;s to see what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
news there is, and later to see if Jean is to the
front.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we cannot hear from Jean to-day and
Paris can still stand without thy political opinion,&rdquo;
but she laughed and shoved him from the
shop, a very tender expression on her lined old
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These men! They think themselves of much
importance,&rdquo; she said as she resumed her pastry
making.</p>

<p>Having tied a great linen apron around Judy&rsquo;s
slender waist (much slenderer in the last month
from her economical living), and having instructed
her in the prices of the cooked food displayed
in the show cases, Mère Tricot turned
over the shop to her care. The rosy baby was
lying in a wooden cradle in the back of the little
shop and the grandmother was in plain view in
the tiny kitchen to be seen beyond the living
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I fancy I am almost domesticated,&rdquo;
thought Judy. &ldquo;What an interior this would
make&mdash;baby in foreground and old Mother Tricot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
on through with her rolling pin. Light fine!
I&rsquo;ve a great mind to paint while I am keeping
shop, sketch, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She whipped out her sketch book and sketched
in her motive with sure and clever strokes, but
art is long and shops must be kept. Customers
began to pile in. The spinach was very popular
and Judy became quite an adept in dishing
it out and weighing it. Potato salad was
next in demand and cooked tongue and rosbif
disappeared rapidly. Many soldiers lounged
in, eating their sandwiches in the shop. Judy
enjoyed her morning greatly but she could
not remember ever in her life having worked
harder.</p>

<p>When the tarts were finished and displayed
temptingly in the window, swarms of children arrived.
It seemed that Mère Tricot&rsquo;s tarts were
famous in the Quarter. More soldiers came, too.
Among them was a face strangely familiar to
the amateur shop girl. Who could it be? It
was the face of a typical Boulevardier: dissipated,
ogling eyes; black moustache and beard waxed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
until they looked like sharp spikes; a face not
homely but rather handsome, except for its expression
of infinite conceit and impertinence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never seen him before, I fancy. It
is just the type that is familiar to me,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais quel type!&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>Judy was looking very pretty, with her cheeks
flushed from the excitement of weighing out
spinach and salad, making change where sous
were thought of as though they were gold and
following the patois of the peasants that came
to buy and the argot of the gamin. She had
donned a white cap of Marie&rsquo;s which was most
becoming. Judy, always ready to act a part,
with an instinctive dramatic spirit had entered
into the rôle of shop keeper with a vim that bade
fair to make the Tricots&rsquo; the most popular place
on Boulevarde Montparnasse. Her French had
fortunately improved greatly since her arrival
in Paris more than two years before and now
she flattered herself that one could not tell she
was not Parisienne.</p>

<p>The soldier with the ogling eyes and waxed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
moustache lingered in the shop when his companions
had made their purchases and departed.
He insisted upon knowing the price of every ware
displayed. He asked her to name the various
confitures in the tarts, which she did rather wearily
as his persistence was most annoying. She
went through the test, however, with as good a
grace as possible. Shop girls must not be squeamish,
she realized.</p>

<p>One particularly inviting gooseberry tart was
left on the tray. Judy had had her eye on it
from the first and trembled every time a purchaser
came for tarts. She meant to ask Mère
Tricot for it, if only no one bought it. And now
this particularly objectionable customer with his
rolling black eyes and waxed moustache was asking
her what kind it was! Why did he not buy
what he wanted and leave?</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eh? Qu&rsquo;est-ce que c&rsquo;est?&rdquo;</i> he demanded with
an amused leer as he pointed a much manicured
forefinger at that particularly desirable tart.</p>

<p>Judy was tired and the French for gooseberry
left her as is the way with an acquired language.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Instead of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">groseille</i> which was the word she
wanted, she blurted out in plain English:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gooseberry jam!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I have bean pensè so mooch. You may
spick ze Eengleesh with me, Mees. Gueseberry
jaam! Ha, ha! An&rsquo; now, Mees, there iss wan
question I should lak a demandè of the so beootifool
demoiselle: what iss the prize of wan leetle
kees made in a so lufly tart?&rdquo; He leaned over the
counter, his eyes rolling in a fine frenzy.</p>

<p>Where was Mère Tricot now? What a fine
time to brandish her pastry board! Gone to the
innermost recesses of the apartment with the rosy
baby! Suddenly Judy remembered exactly where
she had seen that silly face before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Versailles, the day I got on the wrong
train!&rdquo; flashed through her mind. She remembered
well the hateful creature who had sat on
the bench by her and insulted her with his attentions.
She remembered how she had jumped
up from the bench and hurried off, forgetting her
package of gingerbread, bought at St. Cloud,
and how the would-be masher had run after her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
with it, saying in his insinuating manner: &ldquo;You
have forgot your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gouter, cherie</i>. Do you like
puddeen very much, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was certainly the same man. His soldier&rsquo;s
uniform made him somewhat less of a dandy
than his patent leather boots and lemon coloured
gloves had done on that occasion, but the dude
was there in spite of the change of clothes. On
that day at Versailles she had seized the gingerbread
and jammed it in her mouth, thereby disgusting
the fastidious Frenchman. She had often
told the story and her amused hearers had always
declared that her presence of mind was
much to be commended.</p>

<p>The soldier leaned farther and farther over
the counter still demanding: &ldquo;A leetle kees made
in so lufly a tart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ha! An inspiration! Judy grasped the desired
gooseberry tart and thrust the whole thing
into her mouth. There was no time to ask the
leave of Mère Tricot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah quelle betise!&rdquo;</i> exclaimed the dandy, and
at the same moment he, too, remembered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
young English demoiselle at Versailles. He
straightened up and into his ogling eyes came
a spark of shame. With a smile that changed
his whole countenance he saluted Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, Mademoiselle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy&rsquo;s mouth was too full to attempt French
but she managed to say in her mother tongue:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you come in a respectable place like
this and behave just like a Prussian?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prussian! Ah, Mademoiselle, excuse, excuse.
I&mdash;the beauty of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boutiquier</i> made me forget
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la Patrie</i>. I have been a roué, a fool. I am henceforth
a Frenchman. Mademoiselle iss wan noble
ladee. She efen mar her so great beauty to protec
her dignitee. I remember ze <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pain d&rsquo;epice</i> at Versailles
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la grande bouchée</i>. Mademoiselle has
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le bel esprit</i>, what you call Mericanhumor. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au
revoir, Mademoiselle</i>,&rdquo; and with a very humble
bow he departed, without buying anything at all.</p>

<p>The Tricots laughed very heartily when Judy
told them her experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you can take care of yourself,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Père Tricot with a nod of approval. &ldquo;If the Prussians
come, they had better look out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you forgive me for eating the last gooseberry
tart?&rdquo; she asked of Mère Tricot. &ldquo;I was
very glad of the excuse to get it before some one
bought it from under my very nose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mother Tricot not only forgave her but produced
another one for her that she had kept back
for the guest she seemed to delight to honour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boutiquier</i> has sold out the shop,&rdquo; declared
the old man. &ldquo;I shall have to go to market
very early in the morning to get more provisions
cooked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, another excuse for absenting thyself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please, may I go with you?&rdquo; begged Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will mean very early rising, but I shall be
so pleased,&rdquo; said the delighted old man, and his
wife smiled approval.</p>

<p>It was arranged that Judy was to sleep on a
couch in the living room. This suited her exactly,
as she was able after the family had retired to
rise stealthily and open a window. The French
peasant and even the middle class Parisian is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
afraid of air in a bedroom as we would be of
a rattlesnake. They sleep as a rule in hermetically
sealed chambers and there is a superstition
even among the enlightened of that city that night
air will give one some peculiar affection of the
eyes. How they keep as healthy as they do is a
wonder to those brought up on fresh air. Judy
had feared that her sleeping would have to be
done in the great bed with Marie and the baby
and welcomed the proposition of the couch in the
living room with joy. There was a smell of
delicatessen wares but it was not unpleasing to
one who had been economizing in food for so
many days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather smell spinach than American Beauties,&rdquo;
she said to herself, &ldquo;and potato salad beats
potpourri.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her couch was clean and the sheets smelled of
lavender. Marie, the little daughter-in-law, had
been a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blanchisseuse de fin</i> before she became the
bride of Jean Tricot. She still plied her trade on
the family linen and everything she touched was
snow white and beautifully ironed. The clothes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
were carried by her to the public laundry; there
she washed them and then brought them home
to iron.</p>

<p>As Judy lay on the soft, clean couch, sniffing
the mingled smells of shop and kitchen and fresh
sheets, she thanked her stars that she was not
alone in the Bents&rsquo; studio, wondering what she
was to do about breakfast and a little nervous at
every sound heard during the night.</p>

<p>Even the bravest feels a little squeamish when
absolutely alone through the long night. Judy
was brave, her father&rsquo;s own daughter, but those
nights alone in the studio in Rue Brea had got
on her nerves. It was just so much harder because
of the gay, jolly winter spent in the place.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;I feel like one who treads alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some banquet hall, deserted,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>expressed her sentiments exactly. Once she
dreamed that Molly Brown was standing over
her with a cup of hot coffee, which was one of
Molly&rsquo;s ways. She was always spoiling people
and often would appear at the bed side with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
matutinal coffee. The dream came after a particularly
lonesome evening. She thought that
as Molly stood over her, her hand shook and some
of the coffee splashed on her face. She awoke
with a start to find her face wet with hot tears.</p>

<p>Here at the Tricots, life was quite different.
Mère and Père Tricot were playing a happy duet
through the night with comfortable snores.
Marie could be heard cooing to her baby as she
nursed it and the baby making inarticulate gurgles
of joy at being nourished. The feeling of
having human beings near by was most soothing.
Judy did not mind the snores, but rejoiced
in them. Even when the baby cried, as it did
once in the night, she smiled happily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am one of a family!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>A MOTHER&rsquo;S FAITH.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Edwin, Kent has been gone over two weeks
now and not one word from him,&rdquo; announced
Molly when Mr. Bud Woodsmall had come and
gone, leaving no mail of any great importance.
&ldquo;I can see Mother is very uneasy, although she
doesn&rsquo;t say a word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the name of his steamer?&rdquo; asked
the professor as he opened his newspaper. &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t worry. Mail is pretty slow and it would
take a very fast boat to land him at Havre and
have a letter back this soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edwin spoke a little absent-mindedly for the
Greens were very busy getting ready for their
yearly move to Wellington College and time for
newspaper reading was at a premium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he was to cable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! And what was the name of the
steamer?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<cite>L&rsquo;Hirondelle de Mer</cite>, swallow of the sea. I
fancy it must mean flying fish. Paul says it is
a small merchantman, carrying a few passengers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<cite>L&rsquo;Hirondelle de Mer?&rdquo;</cite> Edwin&rsquo;s voice sounded
so faint that Molly stopped packing books and
looked up, startled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be a mistake,&rdquo; he faltered.</p>

<p>Molly jumped up from the box of books and
read over her husband&rsquo;s shoulder the terrible
headlines announcing the sinking of the small
merchantman <cite>L&rsquo;Hirondelle de Mer</cite> by a German
submarine. No warning was given and it was
not known how many of the crew or passengers
had escaped. The news was got from a boat-load
of half-drowned seamen picked up by an
English fishing smack. The cargo was composed
of pork and beef.</p>

<p>Molly read as long as her filling eyes would
permit, and then she sank on her knees by her
husband&rsquo;s chair and gave way to the grief that
overcame her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Molly darling! It may be all right. Kent
is not the kind to get lost if there is any way
out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he would be saving others and forget
himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but see&mdash;or let me see for you&mdash;it says
no women or children on board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God for that!&mdash;And now I must go to
Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I will go with you&mdash;but we must go
with the idea of making your mother feel it is
all right&mdash;that Kent is saved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and I truly believe he is! I couldn&rsquo;t
have been as happy for the last few days as I
have been if&mdash;if&mdash;Kent&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She could say no
more.</p>

<p>Edwin held her for a moment in his arms and
then called to Kizzie to look after little Mildred,
who lay peacefully sleeping in her basket, blissfully
ignorant of the trouble in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look! There&rsquo;s Mother coming through the
garden! She knows! I can tell by the way she
holds her head.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My children! You were coming to me. You
know, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother! But Edwin and I think Kent
is too strong and active to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know he is safe,&rdquo; declared the intrepid
mother. &ldquo;I am as sure of it as though he were
here in the garden of Chatsworth standing by
me. One of my children could not have passed
away without my being conscious of it.&rdquo; She
spoke in an even, clear tone and her countenance
was as one inspired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother! That is what I felt, too. I
could not have been so&mdash;so happy if anything
awful had happened to Kent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edwin Green was very thankful that the
women in his family could take this view of the
matter, but not feeling himself to be gifted with
second sight, he determined to find out for sure
as soon as possible what had become of his favorite
brother-in-law. He accordingly telegraphed
a night letter to Jimmy Lufton in New
York to get busy as quickly as possible, sparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
no expense, and find out if the Americans on
board the vessel were saved.</p>

<p>No doubt my readers will remember that Jimmy
Lufton was the young newspaper man whom
Edwin Green had feared as a rival, and now that
he had won the prize himself, his feeling for that
young man was one of kindliness and pity.</p>

<p>Answer came: a stray sailor had reported that
he had seen the submarine take on board two
of the passengers who were battling with the
heavy sea. Whether Kent was one of them, he
could not tell.</p>

<p>There were days of anxious waiting. Molly
and Edwin went on with the preparations for
their flitting, but could not leave Mrs. Brown
until she had assurance of the safety of her beloved
son. That lady continued in the belief that
all was well with him, in spite of no news.</p>

<p>Aunt Clay came over to Chatsworth to remonstrate
with her younger sister over what she
called her obstinacy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should you persist in the assertion that
you would know if anything had happened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
your son? We all know that things happen all
the time and persons near to them go on in ignorance
of the accidents. For my part, I think
it is indecent for you and your daughters to be
flaunting colours as you are. You should order
your mourning and have services for those lost
at sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s flaunting of colors consisted
of one lavender scarf that Nance Oldham had
knitted for her, this was, to say the least, unnecessary
of Sister Clay.</p>

<p>Molly, who was present when the above unfeeling
remarks were made, trembled with rage
and wept with misery; but not so Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you,&rdquo; she said with a
calmness that astonished her daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if Kent is alive, why does he not communicate
with you? He is certainly careless of
you to leave you in ignorance for all of this
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly noticed with a kind of fierce joy that her
mother&rsquo;s head was now held very high and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
sensitive nostrils were a-quiver. &ldquo;Her nose was
a-wuckin&rsquo;,&rdquo; as Aunt Mary put it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Careless of <em>me!</em> Kent! Sister Sarah, you
are simply speaking with neither sense nor feeling.
It has been your own fault that you have
not obtained the love and affection of my children
and so you wish to insinuate that they are
careless of me. My son will let me know where
he is as soon as he can. I already know he is
alive and safe. You ask me how I know it! I
can only say I know it.&rdquo; This was said with so
much fire that Aunt Clay actually seemed to
shrink up. She bullied Mrs. Brown up to a certain
point, but when that point reached criticism
of one of her children, woe betide Aunt Clay.</p>

<p>Molly, whose certainty of Kent&rsquo;s being alive
was beginning to grow weak and dim with the
weary days, felt new strength from her mother&rsquo;s
brave words. Edwin Green was forced to leave
for the opening of Wellington, but Molly closed
the bungalow and brought little Mildred over to
Chatsworth, there to wait with her mother for
some definite news.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Old Aunt Mary was a great comfort to them.
She shared in their belief that their dear boy
was alive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cose nothin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t happened ter that there
Kent. Didn&rsquo;t he tell me he was a goin&rsquo; ter Parus
ter bring home that Judy gal? The Dutch ain&rsquo;t
a goin&rsquo; ter do nothin&rsquo; ter a kind faceded pusson
like our Kent. As fer drowndin&rsquo;! Shoo! I
done hear Lewis say that Kent kin outswim de
whole er Jeff&rsquo;son County. He kin swim to Indiany
an&rsquo; back thout ever touchin&rsquo; lan&rsquo;, right
over yander by the water wucks whar the riber
is mo&rsquo;n a mile. An&rsquo; waves! Why, Lewis say
whin the big stern wheelers is a jes&rsquo; churnin&rsquo; up
the riber till it looks like the yawnin&rsquo; er grabes
at Jedgement Day that Kent would jes&rsquo; laff at
them an&rsquo; plunge right through jes&rsquo; lak a feesh.
An&rsquo; I do hear tell that the waters er the mighty
deep is salty an&rsquo; that makes me know that Kent
ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; ter sink. Don&rsquo;t we tes&rsquo; the brine fer
pickles wif a aig? An&rsquo; don&rsquo;t the aig float? An&rsquo;
if&rsquo;n the mighty deep is called the briny deep don&rsquo;t
that mean it kin float a aig? What kin float a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
aig kin float a young man what already knows
how ter swim crost an&rsquo; back on the &rsquo;Hier Riber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Julia Kean&rsquo;s second letter came, also the one
from her father in Molly&rsquo;s care. Molly immediately
sent it to the American Club in Paris.
Judy&rsquo;s letter certainly had nothing in it to reassure
them as to her safety, except the meeting
with the old man with whom she had danced at
St. Cloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means that Judy is able to make friends
wherever she goes, and as she says, she can always
light on her feet, somehow,&rdquo; sighed Molly.
She did not add what was in her mind: &ldquo;If she
had only come home with Kent!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, I must write to Judy now that I
have some kind of address. Must I tell her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, tell her all we know, but tell
her of our conviction that all is well. I will write
to her myself, on second thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John and Paul both spent every night at Chatsworth
now, although it meant very early rising
for both of them and often a midnight arrival
or departure for Dr. John, whose practice was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
growing but seemed to be restricted to persons
who persisted in being taken very ill in the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is because so many of them are charity
patients or semi-charity and they always want
to get all they can,&rdquo; he would declare. &ldquo;Of
course, a doctor&rsquo;s night rates are higher than day
rates, and when they are getting something for
nothing, if they call me up at two a.&nbsp;m. they are
getting more for nothing than they would be if
they had their toe aches in the day time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ten days had passed since the half-drowned
sailors had been picked up by the English fishing
smack, and still no message from Kent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown wrote and dispatched her letter
to Judy Kean. It was a hard letter to write, much
harder than it would have been had there been
an engagement between the two. The good lady
felt that Judy was almost like a daughter and
still it required something more than existed to
address her as one. She must convey to Judy
the news that Kent was shipwrecked, and still
she wanted to put in the girl&rsquo;s heart the faith
she had in his safety.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Judy! If she is alone in Paris, think
what it will mean for this news to reach her!&rdquo;
Molly agonized to herself. &ldquo;She may and may
not care for Kent enough to marry him, but she
certainly is devoted to him as a friend. She will
feel it just so much more keenly because he was
on his way to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly could not sleep in her great anxiety, and
her faith and the certainty of Kent&rsquo;s safety left
her. &ldquo;I must keep up for Mildred&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; she
would cry as she tried to choke down food. Her
every endeavor was to hide this loss of faith from
her mother, whose belief in her son&rsquo;s being alive
and well never seemed to falter.</p>

<p>Daily letters from Edwin were Molly&rsquo;s one
comfort. He was back in the grind of lectures at
Wellington and was missing sorely his wife and
child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly darling, you mustn&rsquo;t wait any longer
in Kentucky,&rdquo; her mother said at breakfast one
morning. Molly was trying to dispose of a glass
of milk and a soft boiled egg, although her throat
seemed to close at the thought of food.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mother, I wouldn&rsquo;t leave you for anything
in the world,&rdquo; she declared, making a successful
gulp which got rid of the milk, at least.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your husband needs you, child, and I know
it would be best for you. There is no use in
waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly looked up, startled. Had her mother,
too, lost heart? Her face had grown thinner in
those days of waiting and her hair was quite
grey, in fact, silvery about the temples; but her
eyes still held the light of faith and high resolve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She still has faith! And you, Molly Brown
Green! Oh, ye of little faith! What right have
you to be a clog and burden? Take another glass
of milk this minute and keep up your health and
your baby&rsquo;s health.&rdquo; This to herself, and aloud:
&ldquo;Why, Mumsy, I want to stay right here. Little
Mildred is thriving and Edwin is doing very
well at Wellington. Every one is asking him
out to dine, now that he is untrammelled with a
wife. He reports a big gain in attendance on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
last semestre and is as cheerful as can be. Caroline,
please bring me another glass of milk, and
I think I&rsquo;ll get you to soft boil another egg for
me!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>DES HALLES.</small></h2>


<p>Mère Tricot called Judy just at dawn. The
kindly old grenadier stood over her, and this was
no dream&mdash;she held a real cup of coffee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The good man is ready. I hate to wake you,
but if you want to go to market with him, it is
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! It won&rsquo;t take me a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy gulped the coffee and dived into her
clothes. There seemed to be no question of baths
with the good Tricots, and Judy made a mental
note that she would go every day to the Bents&rsquo;
studio for her cold plunge. A bathroom is the
exception and not the rule in the poorer class
of apartments in Paris. In New York, any apartment
worthy of the name boasts a bathroom, but
not so in the French city.</p>

<p>Père Tricot was waiting for her with his little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
green push cart to bring home the purchases to
be made in market. He was dressed in a stiff,
clean, blue blouse and his kindly, lank old face
was freshly shaven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mam&rsquo;selle! So you will go with the old
man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go with you! Of course I will! I love the
early morning, and the market will be beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The streets were very quiet and misty. Paris
never gets up very early, and as the cold weather
comes, she lies abed later and later. The Gardens
of the Luxembourg were showing signs of
frost, or was it heavy dew? The leaves had begun
to drop and some of them had turned.</p>

<p>There was a delightful nip in the air and as
Judy and the old man trudged along, the girl felt
really happy, happier than she had for many a
day. &ldquo;It must be having a home that is doing
it,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Maybe I am a domestic person,
after all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Père Tricot, don&rsquo;t you love your home?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My home! You don&rsquo;t think that that shop
in Boulevard Montparnasse is my home, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where is your home then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, in Normandy, near Roche Craie! That
is where I was born and hope to die. We are
saving for our old age now and will go back
home some day, the good wife and I. Jean and
Marie can run the shop, that is, if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy knew he meant if Jean came through the
war alive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The city is not for me, but it seemed best to
bring Jean here when he was little. There seemed
no chance to do more than exist in the country,
and here we have prospered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have visited at Roche Craie. I think it is
beautiful country. No wonder you want to go
back. The d&rsquo;Ochtès were my friends there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Marquis d&rsquo;Ochtè! Oh, Mam&rsquo;selle, and
to think of your being their guest and then mine!&rdquo;
Judy could have bitten out her tongue for saying
she had visited those great folk. She could
see now that the dear old man had lost his ease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
in her presence. &ldquo;They are the greatest landowners
of the whole department.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they are quite simple and very kind.
I got to know them through some friends of mine
who were related to the Marquise. She, you
know, was an American.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and a kind, great lady she is. Why, it
was only day before yesterday she was in our
shop. She makes a rule to get what she can from
us for her household. She has a chef who can
make every known sauce, but he cannot make a
tart like my good wife&rsquo;s. We furnish all the
tarts of the d&rsquo;Ochtès when they are in Paris.
Madame, the Marquise, is also pleased to say that
my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pouree d&rsquo;epinard</i> is smoother and better than
Gaston&rsquo;s, and only yesterday she bought a tray
of it for their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner a la fourchette</i>. Her son
Philippe is flying. The Marquis, too, is with his
regiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I wish I could have seen her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, then, Mam&rsquo;selle would not be ashamed
for the Marquise to see her waiting in the shop
of poor Tricot?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ashamed! Why, Père Tricot, what do you
take me for? I am only too glad to help some
and to feel that I can do something besides look
on,&rdquo; and Judy, who had been walking on the
sidewalk while her companion pushed his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite
voiture</i> along the street, stepped down into the
gutter and with her hand on the shaft went the
rest of the way, helping to push the cart.</p>

<p>As they approached the market, they were
joined by more and more pedestrians, many of
them with little carts, similar to Père Tricot&rsquo;s
and many of them with huge baskets. War
seemed to be forgotten for the time being, so bent
were all of them on the business of feeding and
being fed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One must eat!&rdquo; declared a pleasant fat woman
in a high stiff white cap. &ldquo;If Paris is to be entered
to-morrow by the Prussians, I say we must
be fed and full. There is no more pleasure in
dying for your country empty than full.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to the voice of the Halles, Mam&rsquo;selle.
Can&rsquo;t you hear it roaring? Ah! and there is the
bell of St. Eustache.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>The peal of bells rose above the hum of the
market.</p>

<p>&ldquo;St. Eustache! Can&rsquo;t we go into the church
a little while first?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so, hand in hand with the old Normandy
peasant, Judy Kean walked into the great old
church, and together they knelt on the flagged
floor and prayed. Judy never did anything by
halves, not even praying. When she prayed,
she did it with a fervor and earnestness St.
Anthony himself would have envied. When
they rose from their knees, they both looked happier.
Old Tricot had prayed for his boy, so soon
to be in the trenches, and Judy offered an impassioned
petition for the safety of her beloved
parents.</p>

<p>When they emerged from the church, the sun
was up and the market was almost like a carnival,
except for the fact that the color was subdued
somewhat by the mourning that many of the
women wore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Already so many in mourning!&rdquo; thought the
girl. &ldquo;What will it be later?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;First the butter and eggs and cheese! This
way, Mam&rsquo;selle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They wormed their way between the great yellow
wagons unloading huge crates of eggs and
giant cheeses. The smell of butter made Judy
think of Chatsworth and the dairy where she
had helped Caroline churn on her memorable
visit to the Browns. Ah me! How glad she
would be to see them again. And Kent! She
had not let herself think of Kent lately. He must
be angry with her for not taking his advice and
listening to his entreaties to go back to the United
States with him. He had not written at all and
he must have been home several weeks. Maybe
the letter had miscarried, but other letters had
come lately; and he might even have cabled her.
He certainly seemed indifferent to her welfare,
as now that the war had broken out, he had not
even inquired as to her safety or her whereabouts;
not even let her know whether or not the job
in New York had materialized.</p>

<p>She was awakened from her musings by her
old friend, who had completed his bargaining for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
cheese, butter and eggs and now was proceeding
to the fish market.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must buy much fish. It is Friday, you remember,
and since the war started, religion has
become the style again in France, and now fish,
and only fish, must be eaten on Friday. There
are those that say that the war will help the
country by making us good again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so, in a far corner of the cart, well away
from the susceptible butter and cheese, many fish
were piled up, fenced off from the rest of the
produce by a wall of huge black mussels in a
tangle of sea weed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there are fish enough in this market
to regenerate the whole world, I should think,&rdquo;
laughed Judy.</p>

<p>The stalls were laden with them and row after
row of scaly monsters hung from huge hooks
in the walls. Men, women and boys were scaling
and cleaning fish all along the curbings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon there will be only women and boys for
the work,&rdquo; thought Judy sadly, &ldquo;and maybe it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
will not be so very long before there will be only
women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cabbages and cauliflowers were bought next
(cauliflowers that Puddenhead Wilson says are
only cabbages been to college); Brussels sprouts,
too; and spinach enough to furnish red blood
for the whole army, Judy thought; then chickens,
turkeys and grouse; a great smoked beef tongue,
and a hog head for souse. The little green wagon
was running over now and its rather rickety
wheels creaked complainingly.</p>

<p>Old Tricot and Judy started homeward at as
rapid a rate as the load would allow. Judy insisted
upon helping push, and indeed her services
were quite necessary over the rough cobbles.
When they reached the smooth asphalt, she told
Père Tricot she would leave him for a moment
and stop at the American Club in the hope of
letters awaiting there for her.</p>

<p>How sweet and fresh she looked as she waved
her hand at the old man! Her cheeks were rosy,
her eyes shining, and her expression so naïve
and happy that she looked like a little child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, gentile, gentile!&rdquo; he murmured. His old
heart had gone out to this brave, charming American
girl. &ldquo;And to think of her being friends
with Madame the Marquise!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;That
will be a nut for the good wife and Marie to
crack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pushed his cart slowly along the asphalt,
rather missing the sturdy strength that Judy
had put into the work. Then he sat on a bench to
rest awhile, one of those nice benches that Paris
dots her thoroughfares with and one misses so
on coming back to United States.</p>

<p>Paris was well awake now and bustling. The
streets were full of soldiers. Old women with
their carts laden with chrysanthemums were
trudging along to take their stands at the corners.
The air was filled with the pungent odors of
their wares. Old Tricot stretched himself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be moving! There is much food to
be cooked to-day. It is time my Mam&rsquo;selle was
coming along. Ah, there she is!&rdquo; He recognized
the jaunty blue serge jacket and pretty
little velour sport hat that Judy always knew at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
which angle to place on her fluffy brown hair.
&ldquo;But how slowly she is walking! And where
are her roses? Her head is bent down like some
poor French woman who has bad news from the
trenches.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>THE AMERICAN MAIL.</small></h2>


<p>Judy had, clasped in her arms, a package of
mail, unopened except for the letter on top, which
was the one that poor, brave Mrs. Brown had
written her. She had kept throughout the letter
the same gallant spirit of belief in her son&rsquo;s
safety, but Judy could not take that view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone! Gone! and all because of poor miserable,
no-account me!&rdquo; her heart cried out in its
anguish, but she shed no tear and made no sound.
Her face, glowing with health and spirits only
a few minutes ago, was now as pale as a ghost
and her eyes had lost their sparkle.</p>

<p>Père Tricot hastened towards her as she came
slowly down the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear little girl, what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is drowned and all for me&mdash;just my stubbornness!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who? Your father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your brother, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, then, your sweetheart? Your fiancé?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;sometime he might&mdash;that is, we were
not fiancéd, not exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man drew her down on the bench beside
him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now tell me all about it, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma pauvre petite</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Judy told him of her friends in Kentucky.
Of Molly Brown and her brother Kent; of her
own stubbornness in not leaving France when the
war broke out; and then she translated Mrs.
Brown&rsquo;s letter for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but the good lady does not think he is
drowned!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but she is so wonderful, so brave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, are you not wonderful and brave, too?
You must go on with your courage. If a mother
can write as she has done and have faith in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le
bon Dieu</i>, then you must try, too&mdash;that will make
you worthy of such a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belle mère</i>. Does she not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
say that two passengers were seen to be saved
by the enemy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Père Tricot, you are good, good! I will
try&mdash;if Kent&rsquo;s own mother can be so brave, why
surely I must be calm, too, I, who am nothing to
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing? Ah, my dear Mam&rsquo;selle, one who
is nothing does not have young men take trips
across the ocean for her. But look at the spinach
wilting in the sun! We must hasten to get the
cooking done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Judy! All zest had gone out of the morning
for her. She put her package of mail in the
cart, not at all caring if it got at the fishy end,
and wearily began to push. Père Tricot, well
knowing that work was a panacea for sorrow,
let her take her share of the burden, and together
the old peasant in his stiff blue blouse
and the sad young American girl trundled the
provisions down the boulevard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have more letters, my daughter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have not read them yet. I was afraid
of more bad news.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps there is something from the mother
and father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, the big one is from Molly and the others
are just from various friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they reached the shop, of course Mère
Tricot started in with her usual badinage directed
against her life partner, but he soon tipped her
a wink to give her to understand that Judy was
in distress, and the kind old grenadier ceased
her vituperation and went quietly to work washing
spinach and making ready the fowls for the
spit.</p>

<p>Judy took her letters to a green bench in the
diminutive court behind the apartment which
passed for garden, with its one oleander tree
and pots of geraniums. Her heart seemed to
be up in her throat; at least, there was a strange
pulsation there that must be heart. So this was
sorrow! Strange to have lived as long as she
had and never to have known what sorrow was
before! The nearest she had ever come to sorrow
was telling her mother and father good-by
when they started on some perilous trip&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
they had always come back, and she was used to
parting with them.</p>

<p>But Kent&mdash;maybe he would never come back!
It was all very well for Mrs. Brown to refuse
to believe in his being gone forever, but why
should he be the one to be saved, after all? No
doubt the passengers who were lost had mothers
and&mdash;and what? Sweethearts&mdash;there she would
say it! She was his sweetheart even though they
were not really engaged. She knew it now for
a certainty. Kent did not have to tell her what
he felt for her, and now that it was too late, she
knew what she felt for him. She knew now why
she had been so lonesome. It was not merely
the fact that war was going on and her friends
were out of Paris&mdash;it was that she was longing
for Kent. She understood now why she felt so
homeless just at this time. She was no more
homeless than she had always been, but now she
wanted a home and she wanted it to be Kent&rsquo;s
home, too. Fool! fool that she had been! Why
hadn&rsquo;t she gone home like all the sensible Americans
when war was declared? The Browns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
would never forgive her and she would never
forgive herself. She read again Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s
letter. How good she was to have been willing
to have Kent turn right around and go back to
Paris for that worthless Julia Kean. And now he
was gone, and it was all her fault! Ah, me!
Well, life must be lived, if all the color had gone
out of it.</p>

<p>She wearily opened the letter addressed in
Molly&rsquo;s handwriting. It was from her father,
and in it another from her mother, forwarded by
Molly. At last she had heard from them. They,
too, hoped she had gone back to America. Had
taken for granted she had, since they had sent
the letters to Molly. She read them over and
over. The love they had for her was to be seen
in every word. Never again would she part
from them. How she longed for them! They
would understand about Kent, even though she
was not engaged to him. And now she knew
what Bobby would advise her to do were he there
in Paris: &ldquo;Work! Work until you drop from
it, but work!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Already the great range, that stretched the entire
length of the tiny tiled kitchen, was filled
with copper vessels, and appetizing odors were
permeating the living room and the little shop
beyond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me help,&rdquo; said Judy bravely. &ldquo;Must I
mind the shop or do you need me here? I can&rsquo;t
cook, but I can wash spinach and peel potatoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marie can look after the shop this morning,
my dear child, so you go rest yourself,&rdquo; said the
good wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to rest! I want to work!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her work, Mother! Let her work! It
is best so,&rdquo; and Judy&rsquo;s old partner got the blue
bowl, sacred to mayonnaise, and Judy sat on the
bench in the court and stirred and stirred as she
dropped the oil into the beaten egg. Her arm
ached as the great smooth yellow mass grew
thicker and thicker, but the more her arm ached,
the less her heart ached. When the bowl was
quite full, she started in on a great basket of potatoes
that must be peeled, some for Saratoga
chips and some for potato salad. Onions must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
be peeled, too, and then the spinach cleaned and
chopped in a colander until it was a purée.</p>

<p>The Tricots worked with a precision and ease
that delighted Judy. She never tired of watching
the grenadier turn out the wonderful little
tarts. On that morning a double quantity was
to be made as Marie was to carry a basket of
them to &ldquo;the regiment&rdquo;; that, of course, meant
Jean Tricot&rsquo;s regiment. They had not yet been
ordered to the front, but were ready to go at any
moment.</p>

<p>The old woman put batch after batch in the
great oven. They came out all done to a turn
and all exactly alike, as though made by machinery.
Then they were put in the show cases
in the shop; and more were rolled out, filled and
baked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometime may I try to do some?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman smiled indulgently at Judy&rsquo;s
pale face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may try right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy made a rather deformed batch but Mère
Tricot declared the children would not know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
difference, and they could be sold to them. &ldquo;The
soldats must have the prettiest and another time
you can make them well enough for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So far, Judy had not shed a tear. Her eyes
felt dry and feverish and her heart was still beating
in her throat in some mysterious way. Suddenly
without a bit of warning the tears came.
Splash! Splash! they dropped right on the tarts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind the tarts!&rdquo; exclaimed the kindly
grenadier. &ldquo;Those must go to Jean&rsquo;s regiment.
They will understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not help it,&rdquo; sobbed poor Judy. &ldquo;I
was thinking how proud Kent would be of me
when he knew I could make tarts and wondering
how many he could eat, when all of a sudden it
came to me that he never would know&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;Oh,
Mother Tricot!&rdquo; and she buried her
face on the bosom of the good old woman, who
patted her with one hand and held her close while
she adroitly whisked a pan of tarts from the oven
with the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tarts must not burn, no matter if hearts are
broken!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>THE ZEPPELIN RAID.</small></h2>


<p>Judy&rsquo;s cry did her good, although it left her
in such a swollen state she was not fit to keep
shop, which was what she had planned to do
for the afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go round to the studio in Rue Brea
for a little while. I want to get some things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What she really wanted was to get a bath and
to be alone for a few hours. Her kind hosts
thought it would be wise to let her do whatever
she wanted, so they gave her God-speed but
begged her not to be out late.</p>

<p>Judy now longed for solitude with the same
eagerness she had before longed for companionship.
She knew it would be unwise for her to
give up to this desire to any extent and determined
to get back to her kind friends before
dark, but be alone she must for a while. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
got the key from the concierge and entered the
studio. All was as she had left it. Windows and
doors opened wide soon dispelled the close odor.
A cold bath in the very attractive white porcelain
tub, the pride of the Bents, made poor Judy feel
better in spite of herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to feel better. I&rsquo;ve been brave
and noble all morning and now I want to be weak
and miserable. I don&rsquo;t care whether school keeps
or not. I am a poor, forlorn, broken-hearted girl,
without any friends in all the world except some
Normandy peasants. The Browns will all hate
me, and my mother and father I may never see
again. Oh, Kent! Kent! Why didn&rsquo;t you just
pick me up and make me go with you? If you
had been very, very firm, I&rsquo;d have gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy remembered with a grim smile how in
old days at college she had longed to wear mourning
and how absurd she had made herself by
dyeing her hair and draping herself in black. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going into mourning now. It is about all I can
do for Kent. It won&rsquo;t cost much and somehow
I&rsquo;d feel better.&rdquo; Judy, ever visualizing, pictured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
herself in black with organdy collar and cuffs
and a mournful, patient look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just go on selling
tarts. It will help the Tricots and give me
my board.&rdquo; She counted out her money, dwindled
somewhat, but now that she was working
she felt she might indulge her grief to the extent
of a black waist and some white collars and cuffs.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a black skirt and I&rsquo;ll get my blue suit
dyed to-morrow. I&rsquo;ll line my black sport hat with
white crêpe. That will make it do.&rdquo; In pity for
herself, she wept again.</p>

<p>She slipped out of the studio and made her
few purchases at a little shop around the corner.
Madame, the proprietaire, was all sympathy.
She had laid in an especial stock of cheap mourning,
she told Judy, as there was much demand
for it now.</p>

<p>It took nimble fingers to turn the jaunty sport
hat into a sad little mourning bonnet, but Judy
was ever clever at hat making, and when she
finished just before the sun set, she viewed her
handiwork with pardonable pride. She slipped
into her cheap black silk waist and pinned on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
collar and cuffs. The hat was very becoming,
so much so that Judy had another burst of tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear for it to be becoming. I want
to look as ugly and forlorn as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She determined to leave her serge suit in the
studio and come on the following day to take
it to a dye shop. As she was to do this, she decided
not to leave the key with the concierge but
take it with her.</p>

<p>Her kind friends looked sadly at the mourning.
They realized when they saw it that Judy had
given up all hope of her friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, the pity of it! The pity of it!&rdquo; exclaimed
the old grenadier.</p>

<p>Marie, whose apple-like countenance was not
very expressive of anything but health, looked as
sympathetic as the shape of her face would allow.
Round rosy cheeks, round black eyes, and
a round red mouth are not easy to mold into
tragic lines, but Judy knew that Marie was feeling
deeply for her. She was thinking of her
Jean and the possibility of turning her bridal
finery into mourning. There was so much mourning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
now and according to the <cite>Temps</cite>, the war
was hardly begun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have my serge suit dyed to-morrow,&rdquo; Judy
confided to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, no! Do not have it dyed! Mère Tricot
and I can do it here and do it beautifully. The
butcher&rsquo;s wife over the way is dyeing to-morrow
and she will give us some of her mixture. It is
her little brother who fell only yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night there was great excitement in the
Montparnasse quarter. A fleet of air ships circled
over the city, dropping bombs as they flew.
The explosions were terrific. The people
cowered in their homes at first and then came
rushing out on the streets as the noise subsided.</p>

<p>Père Tricot came back with the news that no
great harm had been done, but it was his opinion
that the Prussians had been after the Luxembourg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They know full well that our art treasures
are much to us, and they would take great pleasure
in destroying them. The beasts!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did the bombs strike?&rdquo; asked Judy
from her couch in the living room. She had
wept until her pillow had to be turned over and
then had at last sunk into a sleep of exhaustion
only to be awakened by the ear-splitting explosions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly, but it was somewhere
over towards the Gardens of the Luxembourg. I
thank the good God you were here with us, my
child.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>&ldquo;L&rsquo;HIRONDELLE DE MER.&rdquo;</small></h2>


<p>Kent Brown, when he reached New York on
his return trip to Paris in quest of the rather
wilful, very irritating, and wholly fascinating
Judy, got his money changed into gold, which
he placed in a belt worn under his shirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no telling what may happen,&rdquo; he
said to the young Kentuckian, Jim Castleman,
with whom he had struck up an acquaintance on
the train. &ldquo;Gold won&rsquo;t melt in the water if we
do get torpedoed, and if I have it next me, whoever
wants it will have to do some tearing off of
clothes to get it. And what will I be doing while
they are tearing off my clothes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good idea! I reckon I&rsquo;ll do the same&mdash;not
that I have enough to weigh myself down with.&rdquo;
Castleman was on his way to France to fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a hang whether I fight with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
English, French, Serbs or Russians, just so I
get in a few licks on the Prussians.&rdquo; He was
a strapping youth of six feet three with no more
idea of what he was going up against than a
baby. War was to him a huge football game
and he simply meant to get into the game.</p>

<p>The <cite>Hirondelle</cite> was a slow boat but sailing
immediately, so Kent and his new friend determined
to take it, since its destination, Havre,
suited them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like the name, too,&rdquo; declared Kent, who
shared with his mother and Molly a certain poetic
sentiment in spite of his disclaimer of any such
foolishness.</p>

<p>There were very few passengers, the boat being
a merchantman. Kent and Jim were thrown
more and more together and soon were as confidential
as two school girls. Kent had been
rather noncommittal in his replies at first to
Jim&rsquo;s questions as to what his business was in
the war zone at such a time if it were not fighting.
As their friendship grew and deepened,
as a friendship can on shipboard in an astonishingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
short time, Kent was glad enough to talk
about Judy and his mission in Paris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She sounds like a corker! When is it to be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it is to be, at all,&rdquo; blushed
Kent. &ldquo;You see, we are not what you might call
engaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your fault or hers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, we have just drifted along. Somehow
I didn&rsquo;t like to tie her down until I could make
good&mdash;and she&mdash;well, I believe she felt the same
way; but of course I can&rsquo;t say. She knows perfectly
well that I have never looked at another
girl since I saw her at Wellington when she and
my sister graduated there. She has&mdash;well,&mdash;browsed
a little, but I don&rsquo;t think she ever meant
anything by it. We get along like a house afire,&mdash;like
the same things,&mdash;think the same way,&mdash;we
have never talked out yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I think you were
an ass not to settle the matter long before
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think so? Do you think it would
have been fair? Why, man, I owed some money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to my mother for my education in Paris and did
not even have a job in sight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! What difference does that make?
Don&rsquo;t you reckon girls have as much spunk about
such things as men have? If I ever see the girl
I want bad enough to go all the way to Paris to
get her, I&rsquo;ll tell her so and have an answer if I
haven&rsquo;t a coat to my back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right. I just didn&rsquo;t want
to be selfish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Selfish! Why, they like us selfish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kent laughed at the wisdom of the young
Hercules. No doubt they (whoever &ldquo;they&rdquo; might
be) did like Castleman selfish or any other way.
He looked like a young god as he sprawled on
deck, his great muscular white arm thrown over
his head to keep the warm rays of the sun out
of his eyes. His features were large and well
cut, his hair yellow and curly in spite of the vigorous
efforts he made to brush it straight. His
eyes were blue and childlike with long dark
lashes, the kind of eyes girls always resent having
been portioned out to men. There was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
great mentality expressed in his countenance but
absolute honesty and good nature. One felt
he was to be trusted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it seem strange to be loafing around
here on this deck with no thought of war and
of the turmoil we shall soon be in?&rdquo; said Jim
one evening at sunset when they were nearing
their port. &ldquo;We have only a day, or two days
at most, before we will be in Paris, and still it
is so quiet and peaceful out here that I can hardly
believe there is any other life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, too! I feel as though I had been born
and bred on this boat. All the other things that
have happened to me are like a dream and this
life here on the good old <cite>Hirondelle de Mer</cite> is
the only real thing. I wonder if all the passengers
feel this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were no women on board but the other
passengers were Frenchmen, mostly waiters from
New York, going home to fight for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la France</i>.
The cargo was pork and beef, destined to feed
the army of France.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that thing sticking up in the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
out yonder?&rdquo; exclaimed Kent. &ldquo;It looks like
the top of a mast just disappearing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wreck, I reckon!&rdquo; exclaimed Jim.</p>

<p>Kent smiled at his countryman&rsquo;s &ldquo;reckon.&rdquo;
Having been away from the South for many
months, it sounded sweet to his ears. The &ldquo;guess&rdquo;
of the Northerner and &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; of the Englishman
did not mean the same to him.</p>

<p>The lookout saw the mast-like object at the
same time they noted it, and suddenly there
was a hurrying and scurrying over the whole
ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s sunk entirely out of sight! Jim
Castleman, that&rsquo;s a German submarine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shock that followed only a moment afterwards
was indescribable. It threw both of the
Kentuckians down. They had hastened to the
side of the vessel, the better to view the strange
&ldquo;thing sticking up out of the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boats were lowered very rapidly and filled
by the crazed passengers and crew. The poor
waiters had not expected to serve their country
by drowning like rats. As for the crew,&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
were noncombatants and not employed to serve
any country in any way. They were of various
nationality, many of them being Portuguese with
a sprinkling of Scandinavians.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a life preserver, Brown! Better put
it on. This ain&rsquo;t the Ohio.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! I&rsquo;ll take my chances in the water any
day rather than in one of those boats. Can you
swim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! I can do three miles without knowing
it. And you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hump! Brought up within a mile of the Ohio
River and been going over to Indiana and back
without landing ever since I was in pants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s dive now and get clear of the sinking
boat. If anything happens to me and you
get clear, you write my sister in Lexington&mdash;she&rsquo;s
all I have left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Jim! Let&rsquo;s shake. If I give out
and you get through, please go get Judy and
take her back to my mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a go! But see here, there is nothing
going to happen to us if endurance will count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
for anything. Have you got on your money
belt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and you?&rdquo; said Kent, feeling for the
gold he carried around his waist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all ready then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boats, loaded to their guards, were putting
off. Our young men felt it was much safer
to trust to themselves than to the crazy manning
of the already overloaded boats. They were
singularly calm in their preparations as they
strapped on the life preservers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim, throw away the papers you have, recommending
you to that French general. We may
get picked up by the submarine, and as plain,
pleasure-seeking Americans we have a much better
chance of being treated properly than if one
of us was going to join the Allies.&rdquo; Kent had
inherited from his mother the faculty of keeping
his head in time of peril.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good eye, old man! They are in my grip and
can just stay there. I reckon I&rsquo;m a&mdash;a&mdash;book
agent. That won&rsquo;t compromise me any.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, stick to it! And here goes! We
must stay together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Kentuckians dived as well as the bulky
life preservers would permit and then they swam
quietly along side by side. The ship was rapidly
settling. The last boat was off, so full that every
little wave splashed over its panic-stricken passengers.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>TUTNO.</small></h2>


<p>The sea was comparatively calm and quite
warm. If it had been anything but a shipwreck,
our young men would have enjoyed the experience.
They congratulated themselves that they
had trusted to their own endurance and the life
preservers rather than to the crazy boats when
they saw one of the overloaded vessels come
within an ace of turning turtle.</p>

<p>The submarine was now on top of the water
and was slowly steaming towards the scene of disaster.
The boats made for the opposite direction
as fast as the oarsmen could pull. They
had not realized that all the submarine wanted
was to destroy the pork and beef cargo. The
hungrier the French army got the sooner they
would be conquered by the Germans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my friend the book agent, what do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
think about swimming in the direction of the
enemy? Remember we are Americans, just plain
Americans with no desire to do anything in the
way of swatting Prussians.&mdash;Neutral noncombatants!&rdquo;
said Kent, swimming easily, the life
preserver lifting him so far out of the water
that he declared he felt like a bell buoy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll remember! My line is family albums
and de luxe copies of Ruskin. I hope those poor
devils in the boats will make land or get picked
up or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, too! If the sea only stays so smooth they
can make a port in less than a day, if they don&rsquo;t
come a cropper. We are almost in the English
Channel, I should say, due south of the Scilly
Islands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I feel as though I belonged on them&mdash;here
we are shipwrecked and floating around like
a beach party, conversing as quietly as though it
were the most ordinary occurrence to book agents
and damsel seekers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no use in getting in a stew. I have
a feeling that the Germans are going to pick us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
up. They are heading this way and I don&rsquo;t
reckon they will let us sink before their eyes. If
they don&rsquo;t pick us up, we are good for many
hours of this play. I feel as fresh as a daisy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God, there weren&rsquo;t any women and
children on board!&rdquo; said Kent fervently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was feeling that all the time. I&rsquo;d hate
to think of their being in those crazy boats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The German boat was quite close to them now.
The deck was filled with men, all of them evidently
in great good humour with themselves and
Fate because of the terrible havoc they had played
with the poor <cite>Hirondelle de Mer</cite>, who was now
at her last gasp, the waves washing over her upper
decks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<cite>Wei gehts?&rdquo;</cite> shouted Jim, raising himself up
far in the water and wigwagging violently at the
death dealing vessel.</p>

<p>It was only a short time before the efficient
crew had Kent and Jim on board, in dry clothes
and before an officer. The fact that they were
Americans was beyond dispute, but their business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
on the other side was evidently taken with
a grain of salt by the very keen looking, alert
young man who questioned them in excellent
English.</p>

<p>Jim was quite glib with his book agent tale.
He got off a line of talk about the albums that
almost convulsed Kent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why were you going to Paris to sell such
things? Would a country at war be a good field
for such an industry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the country will not be at war long. We
expect the Germans to have conquered in a short
time, and then they will want many albums for
the snapshots they have taken during the campaign.
I have been sent as an especial favor by
my company, who wish to honor me. I hate
to think of all my beautiful books being sunk in
the <cite>Hirondelle</cite>.&rdquo; Jim looked so sad and depressed
that the young officer offered him a mug of beer
and urged him to try the Bologna sausage that
was among the viands waiting for them.</p>

<p>Kent&rsquo;s reason for going to Paris was received
with open doubt. It was very amusing in a way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
that they should be completely taken in by Jim&rsquo;s
ingenuous tale of albums while Kent, telling the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
should be doubted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to Paris to bring home a young lady?
Is she your sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she is a friend of my sister,&rdquo; answered
Kent, feeling very much as though he were saying
a lesson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know Paris?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I studied architecture at the Beaux Arts
last winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, then your sympathies are with France!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am an American and my nation is remaining
neutral on the war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, your nation but not the individuals!
What were your intentions after finding the
young lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To take her back to United States as fast as
we could go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well! I am afraid the young lady
will have to content herself in Paris for some
weeks yet, as we are bound for other ports now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Make yourselves at home,&rdquo; and with a salute the
officer left them to the welcome meal which had
immediately been furnished them after their
ducking.</p>

<p>If the Kentuckians had had nothing to do but
enjoy life on that submarine, no doubt they
could have done it. They were treated most
courteously by officers and men. The food was
plentiful and wholesome, the life was interesting
and conversation with the sailors most instructive,
but Jim was eager to strike that blow against
Prussia and it was extremely irksome to him
to have to keep up the farce of being a book agent.
Kent was more and more uneasy about Judy,
realizing, from the sample of Germans he now
came in contact with, that ruthlessness was the
keynote of their character. They were fighting
to win, and win they would or die in the attempt;
by fair means or foul, they meant to conquer
the whole world who did not side with
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, if I don&rsquo;t believe they can do it,&rdquo; sighed
Jim, as he and his friend were having one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
their rare tete-a-tetes. &ldquo;They have such belief
in their powers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they seem much more stable, somehow,
than the French. Did you ever imagine anything
like the clockwork precision with which this monster
is run?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do you reckon we will get off of her?
We have been on a week now and I see no signs
of landing us. I am always asking that human
question mark, Captain von Husser, what he is
going to do with us, and he just smiles until his
moustache ends stick into his eyes, and looks
wise. I feel like Hansel and Gretel and think
maybe they are fattening us to eat later on. I
am getting terribly flabby and fat,&rdquo; and Jim felt
his muscles and patted his stomach with disapproval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d certainly like to know where we are. You
notice they never tell us a thing, and since we
are allowed only in the cabin and on a certain
part of the deck, we never have a chance at the
chart. I wish they would let us bunk alone and
not have that fat head in with us. This is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
first time they have let us talk together since
we got hauled in, and I bet some one is to blame
for this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kent had hardly spoken before a flushed lieutenant
came hurriedly up and with ill-concealed
perturbation entered into conversation with
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz!&rdquo; thought Kent. &ldquo;I wish Jim Castleman
and I knew some kind of a language that
these butchers did not know. But the trouble
is they are so terribly well educated they know
all we know and three times as much besides.&rdquo;
Suddenly there flashed into his mind a childish
habit the Browns used to have of speaking in a
gibberish called Tutno. &ldquo;I wonder if Jim knows
it! I&rsquo;ve a great mind to try him.&rdquo; Putting his
hand on his friend&rsquo;s arm, he said quite solemnly:
&ldquo;Jug i mum, sank a nun tut, yack o u, tut a lul
kuk, Tutno.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sus u rur e!&rdquo; exclaimed Jim, delightedly.</p>

<p>The lieutenant looked quite startled, wigwagged
to a brother officer who was passing and
spoke hurriedly to him in German. As German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
was worse than Greek to Kent and Jim (they
had studied some Greek at school but knew no
German) they did not know for sure what they
were saying, but from the evident excitement of
the two officers they gathered they had quite upset
the calculations of their under-sea hosts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gug o tot, &rsquo;e mum, gug o i nun gug, sus o
mum e!&rdquo; exclaimed Kent with such a mischievous
twinkle in his eye that the two officers bristled
their moustaches in a fury of curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yack o u, bub e tut!&rdquo; was Jim&rsquo;s cryptic rejoinder.</p>

<p>For the benefit of my readers who have never
whiled away the golden hours of childhood with
Tutno or who have perchance forgotten it, I
reckon (being a Southerner myself, I shall say
reckon) I had better explain the intricacies of
the language. Tutno is a language which is
spoken by spelling and every letter sounds like
a word. The vowels remain the same as in English
but the consonants are formed by adding u
and then the same consonant again. For instance:
M is mum; N is nun; T is tut; R is rur.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
There are a few exceptions which vary in different
localities making the language slightly different
in the states. In Kentucky, C is sank; Y
is yack; J is jug. Now when Jim exclaimed:
&ldquo;Yack o u bub e tut!&rdquo; he conveyed the simple
remark: &ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; to Kent&rsquo;s knowing
ears.</p>

<p>Kent had opened the conversation by the brilliant
remark: &ldquo;Jim, can you speak Tutno?&rdquo; and
Jim had answered: &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; Then Kent had
come back with: &ldquo;Got &rsquo;em going some!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Kentuckians were in great distress when
they realized that no doubt the sinking of the
<cite>Hirondelle de Mer</cite> had been reported in the
United States and that their families must be in
a state of doubt as to their whereabouts. They
had requested the Captain to let them send a
message if possible, and he had told them with
great frankness that in war time the women must
expect to be uncertain. Two more ships had been
sunk since they had been taken on board, but they
were kept in ignorance as to what ships they
were or what had been the fate of the crew or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
passengers. They knew that some men had been
added to the number of prisoners on board, but as
they were kept in a compartment to themselves,
they never saw them.</p>

<p>Between operations, when the submarine came
up on top of the water and all on board swarmed
on deck to smoke and enjoy the fresh air and
sunshine, Kent and Jim were politely conducted
down into the cabin after they were deemed to
have had enough, and then the other prisoners,
whoever they were, were evidently given an airing.</p>

<p>After our young men started their Tutno game
they were never left alone one minute. Such a
powwowing as went on after it was reported
was never beheld. It was evidently considered
of grave international importance. Once they
found their keeper taking furtive notes. Evidently
they hoped to gain something by finding
out what the Americans were saying.</p>

<p>The plentiful food that had at first been served
to them was growing more meagre and less
choice. There was nothing but a small portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of black bread with very bad butter and a cup
of coffee for breakfast; a stew of a nondescript
canned meat and more black bread for dinner,
and for supper nothing but black bread with a
smearing of marmalade.</p>

<p>Jim&rsquo;s superfluous flesh began to go and Kent
got as lean as a grey hound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pup rur o vuv i sus i o nun sus, lul o wuv, I
rur e sack kuk o nun!&rdquo; said Jim, tightening his
belt.</p>

<p>It had been more than two weeks since the sinking
of the <cite>Hirondelle</cite> and the young men were
growing very weary of the life. Their misery
was increasing because of the uncertainty they
knew their families must be in. No respite was
in sight. They could tell by the balmy air when
they were allowed on deck that they were further
south than they had been when they were struck,
but where, they had not the slightest idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The water looks as it does around Burmuda,
but surely we are not over there,&rdquo; said Kent in
Tutno.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord knows where we are!&rdquo; answered
Jim in the same language.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish the brutes would let us telegraph our
folks, somehow. They could do it if they chose.
They can do anything, these Prussians.&rdquo; When
Kent said Prussians in Tutno: &ldquo;Pup rur u sus
sus i nun sus,&rdquo; the young officer whose turn it
was to guard them whipped out his note book
and examined it closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sus often repeated!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>THE &ldquo;SIGNY.&rdquo;</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;The orders of the Commander are for the
Americans to disembark!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A lieutenant clicked his heels in front of our
friends and saluted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bub u lul lul yack!&rdquo; shouted Jim. &ldquo;Where?
When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Immediately!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The submarine was on the surface of the
water, but Jim and Kent had been ushered below,
evidently to give their mysterious fellow prisoners
a turn at the deck. They were never allowed
to see them, and to this day are absolutely ignorant
as to who they were or how many or of
what nationality.</p>

<p>It turned out that a Swedish vessel, the <cite>Signy</cite>,
had been sighted thirteen miles off the Spanish
port of Camariñas. She was signaled and ordered
to take aboard the Kentuckians and land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
them. Explicit commands were given the captain
of the <cite>Signy</cite> that she was to land the young
men immediately.</p>

<p>Kent and Jim were too glad to get off the submarine
to care where they were being landed.
They only hoped it was not in South America.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gug o o dud bub yack!&rdquo; shouted Jim to the
grinning crew of the German vessel.</p>

<p>The young lieutenant of the inquisitive mind
made another note in his little book as the life
boat from the Swedish ship bore the young men
away.</p>

<p>They were very cordially received on board the
<cite>Signy</cite> but not allowed to stay a moment longer
than was necessary. The ship steamed to within
a few miles of the Spanish port, all the time being
followed up by the submarine, then the boats
were lowered again and Kent and Jim rowed to
shore. They were given a good meal in the interim,
however, one that they were most pleased
to get, too, as black bread and canned stew had
begun to pall on these favored sons of Kentucky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where in the thunder is Camariñas?&rdquo; queried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Kent. &ldquo;I know it is Spain, but is it north, south,
east or west?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon it isn&rsquo;t east and that&rsquo;s about all
I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It proved to be in the northwest corner and
after some mix-ups, a person was found who
could speak English. The American Consul was
tracked, cablegrams were sent to Kentucky apprising
their families of their safety, and at last
our friends were on the train en route for Paris.</p>

<p>It was a long and circuitous journey, over and
under and around mountains. They would have
enjoyed it at any other time, but Kent was too
uneasy about Judy to enjoy anything, and Jim
was too eager to get in line to swat the Prussians,
as he expressed it, to be interested in Spanish
scenery. They traveled third class as they
had no intention of drawing too recklessly on
their hoarded gold.</p>

<p>After many hours of travel by day and night,
they finally arrived in Paris. It was eleven at
night and our young men were weary, indeed.
The hard benches of the third class coaches had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
made their impression and they longed for sheets
and made-up beds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A shave! A shave! My kingdom for a shave!&rdquo;
exclaimed Kent, as they stretched their stiffened
limbs after tumbling out of the coach in the Gare
de Sud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget I am a stranger in a strange
land, so put me wise,&rdquo; begged Jim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know a terribly cheap little hotel on Montparnasse
and Raspail where we can put up, without
even the comforts of a bum home, but we can
make out there and it is cheap. The <cite>Haute
Loire</cite> is its high sounding name, but it is not high,
I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s do it. I hope there is some kind of
a bath there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust so, but if there isn&rsquo;t, we can go to a
public bath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Kentuckians were a very much dishevelled
pair. They had purchased the necessary toilet
articles at Camariñas, but sleeping for nights in
suits in which they had already had quite a
lengthy swim did not improve their appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
The submariners had pressed their clothes after
their ducking, but Jim&rsquo;s trousers had shrunk
lengthways until he said he felt like Buster
Brown, and Kent&rsquo;s had dried up the other way,
so that in walking two splits had arrived across
his knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We look like tramps, but the <cite>Haute Loire</cite> is
used to our type. I don&rsquo;t believe we could get
into a good hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to look up your girl&mdash;excuse
me, I mean Miss Kean, before you replenish your
wardrobe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I must not wait a minute. I would
like to do it to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night! Man, you are crazy! Get that
alfalfa off your face first. One night can&rsquo;t get
her into much trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right. I am worn out, too,
and a night&rsquo;s rest and a shave will do wonders
for both of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paris looked very changed to Kent. The
streets were so dark and everything looked so sad,
very different from the gay city he had left only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
a few weeks before. The <cite>Haute Loire</cite> had not
changed, though. It was the same little hospitable
fifth class joint. The madame received the
exceedingly doubtful looking guests with as much
cordiality as she would had they been the President
of the Republic and General Joffre.</p>

<p>There were no baths that night, but tumbling
into bed, our Kentuckians were lost to the world
until the next day. What if the Prussians did
fly over the city, dropping bombs on helpless noncombatants?
Two young men who had been torpedoed;
had floated around indefinitely in the Atlantic
Ocean; had been finally picked up by the
submarine that had done the damage; had remained
in durance vile for several weeks on the
submarine, resorting to Tutno to have any private
conversation at all; and at last been transferred
to a Swedish vessel and dumped by them
on the northwest coast of Spain&mdash;those young
men cared little whether school kept or not. The
bombs that dropped that night were nothing more
than pop crackers to them. The excitement in
the streets did not reach their tired ears.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Kent dreamed of Chatsworth and of taking
Judy down to Aunt Mary&rsquo;s cabin so the old
woman could see &ldquo;that Judy gal&rdquo; once more.
Jim Castleman dreamed he swatted ten thousand
Prussians, which was a sweet and peaceful dream
to one who considered swatting the Prussians a
privilege.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>THE CABLEGRAM.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Tingaling, aling, aling! Phome a ringin&rsquo;
agin! I bet that&rsquo;s Mr. Paul,&rdquo; declared Caroline,
the present queen of the Chatsworth kitchen. &ldquo;I
kin tell his ring ev&rsquo;y time. I&rsquo;m a goin&rsquo; ter answer
it, Miss Molly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly, who was ironing the baby&rsquo;s cap strings
and bibs (work she never trusted any one to do),
smiled. It was one of Caroline&rsquo;s notions that
each person had a particular way of ringing the
telephone. She was always on the alert to answer
the &ldquo;phome,&rdquo; and would stop anything she
was doing and tear to be first to take down the
receiver, although it always meant that some
member of the family must come and receive the
message which usually was perfectly unintelligible
to the willing girl.</p>

<p>The telephone was in the great old dining room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
because, as Mrs. Brown said, every one would
call up at meal time and if you were there, you
were there. Molly followed Caroline to the dining
room, knowing full well that she would be
needed when once the preliminaries were over.
She gathered the cap strings and bibs, now neatly
ironed and ready for the trip to Wellington that
she would sooner or later have to take.</p>

<p>Still no news from the <cite>Hirondelle de Mer</cite>, that
is, no news from Kent. The last boat load of
sailors and passengers had been taken up, but
none of them could say for sure whether the two
Kentuckians had been saved or not. One man
insisted he had seen the submarine stop and take
something or some one on board, but when closely
questioned he was quite hazy as to his announcement.
Jimmy Lufton had kept the cables hot
trying to find out something. The Browns and
Jim Castleman&rsquo;s sister had communicated with
each other on the subject of the shipwrecked boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Low!&rdquo; she heard Caroline mutter with that
peculiarly muffled tone that members of her race
always seem to think they must assume when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
speaking through the telephone. &ldquo;This here is
Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s res-i-d-e-n-c-e! Yessir! This here
is Ca&rsquo;line at the phome. Yessir! Miss Molly
done made yo&rsquo; maw eat her breakfus&rsquo; in the baid.
No, sir, not to say sick in the baid&mdash;yessir, kinder
sick on the baid. Yessir! Miss Molly is a launderin&rsquo;
of the cap ties fer the baby. We is all
well, sir, yessir. I&rsquo;ll call Miss Molly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course she hung up the receiver before
Molly could drop her cap strings and reach the
telephone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Caroline, why did you hang it up? Was
it Mr. Paul?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yassum! It were him. I done tole you I
could tell his ring. I hung up the reception cause
I didn&rsquo;t know you was so handy, an&rsquo; I thought if
I kep it down, it might was&rsquo;e the phome somehow,
while I went out to fetch you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly couldn&rsquo;t help laughing, although it was
very irritating for Caroline to be so intensely stupid
about telephoning. Paul, knowing Caroline&rsquo;s
ways, rang up again in a moment and Molly was
there ready to get the message herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly, honey, are you well? Is Mother well?
How is the baby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All well, Paul! Any news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good news, Molly!&rdquo; Molly dropped all the
freshly ironed finery and leaned against the wall
for support. &ldquo;A cablegram from Spain! Kent
was landed there by the German submarine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kent! Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As sure as shootin&rsquo;! Let me read it to you&mdash;&lsquo;Safe&mdash;well,
Kent.&rsquo; Tell Mother as soon as you
can, Molly, but go easy with it. Good news
might knock her out as much as bad news. I&rsquo;ll
be out with John as fast as his tin Lizzie can buzz
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Safe! Kent alive and well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly&rsquo;s knees were trembling so she could
hardly get to her mother&rsquo;s room, where that good
lady had been pretending to eat her breakfast in
bed. Old Shep, standing by her bedside, had a
suspiciously greasy expression around his mouth
and was very busy licking his lips, which imparted
the information to the knowing Molly that
her mother&rsquo;s dainty breakfast had disappeared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
a spot to which it was not destined by the two
anxious cooks, Molly and Caroline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly, what is it? I heard the &rsquo;phone ring.
Was it Paul?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother! Good news!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown closed her eyes and lay back on her
pillows, looking so pale that Molly was scared.
How fragile the good lady was! Her profile was
more cameo-like than ever. These few weeks of
waiting, in spite of the brave front she had shown
to the world, had told on her. Could she stand
good news any better than she could bad?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kent?&rdquo; she murmured faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother, a cablegram! &lsquo;Safe, well,
Kent.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spain, I don&rsquo;t know what part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then the long pent-up flood gates were
opened and Mrs. Brown and Molly had such a
cry as was never seen or heard of. The cap
strings that Molly had dropped on the floor when
she heard that there was news, she had gathered
up in one wild swoop on the way to her mother&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
room, and these were first brought into requisition
to weep on, and then the sheets and the napkin
from the breakfast tray, and at last even old
Shep had to get damp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bus&rsquo; stop ad gall up Zue ad Ad Zarah. Oh,
Bother, Bother, how good God is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, darling, He is good whether our Kent
was spared to us or not,&rdquo; said Mrs. Brown, showing
much more command of her consonants than
poor Molly.</p>

<p>Caroline appeared, one big grin, bearing little
Mildred in her arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She done woke up an&rsquo; say ter me: &lsquo;Ca&rsquo;line,
what all dis here rumpus &rsquo;bout?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mildred had as yet said nothing more than
&ldquo;Goo! Goo!&rdquo; that brought the smiles to Molly and
Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lawd Gawd a mussy! Is Mr. Kent daid?
Is that what Mr. Paul done phomed? I mus&rsquo; run
tell Aunt Mary. I boun&rsquo; ter be the fust one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Caroline! Mr. Kent is alive and
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Live an&rsquo; well! Well, Gawd be praised!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
When I come in an&rsquo; foun&rsquo; you all a actin&rsquo; lak what
the preacher says will be in the las&rsquo; day er jedgment,
a weepin&rsquo; an&rsquo; wailin&rsquo; an&rsquo; snatchin&rsquo; er teeth,
I say ter myse&rsquo;f: &lsquo;Ca&rsquo;line, that there dream you

drownin&rsquo; referred.&rsquo; Well, Miss Molly, if&rsquo;n you&rsquo;ll
hol&rsquo; the baby, I&rsquo;ll go tell Aunt Mary the good
news, too. Cose &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t quite so scrumptious to
be the fust ter carry good news as &rsquo;tis bad, but
then news is news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sue was telephoned to immediately and joined
in the general rejoicing. Aunt Sarah Clay was
quite nonplussed for a moment because of the attitude
she had taken about the family mourning,
but her affection for her sister, which was really
very sincere in spite of her successful manner of
concealing it, came to the fore and she, too, rejoiced.
Of course she had to suggest, to keep in
character, that Kent might have communicated
with his family sooner if he only would have exerted
himself, but Molly was too happy to get
angry and only laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Clay can no more help her ways than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
chestnut can its burr.&rdquo; And then she remembered
how as children they would take sticks and
beat the chestnut burrs open and she wondered
if a good beating administered on Aunt Clay
might not help matters. She voiced this sentiment
to her mother, who said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Molly, Life has administered the
beating on your Aunt Clay long ago. It is being
childless that makes her so bitter. I know that
and that is the reason I am so patient, at least, I
try to be patient with her. Of course, she always
asserts she is glad she has no children, that my
children have been a never ending anxiety to me
and she is glad she is spared a similar worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mother, we are not a never-ending anxiety,
are we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my darling, but an anxiety I would not
be without for all the wealth of the Indies.
Aren&rsquo;t you a little bit anxious all the time about
your baby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, just a teensy weensy bit, but then
I haven&rsquo;t got used to her yet.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, when you get used to her, she will be
just that much more precious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But then I have just one, and you have
seven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think you love her seven times as
much as I love you, or Kent or Milly or any of
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother, of course I don&rsquo;t. I know you
love all of us just as much as I love my little
Mildred, only I just don&rsquo;t see how you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you will have to have seven children to
understand how I can, but when you realize what
it means to have Mildred, maybe you can understand
what it has meant always to poor Sister
Sarah never to have had any children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is hard on her but, Mother dear,
if she had had the seven and you had never had
any, do you think for a minute you would have
been as porcupinish and cactus-like in your attitude
toward the world and especially toward
Aunt Clay&rsquo;s seven as she is toward yours?
Never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly&rsquo;s statement was not to be combatted, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Mrs. Brown was not sure what she would
have been like without her seven anxieties; but
Molly knew that she would have been the same
lovely person, no matter how many or how few
children she had had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try to feel differently toward
Aunt Clay,&rdquo; she whispered into her baby&rsquo;s ear, as
she cuddled her up to her after the great rite of
bathing her was completed that morning. &ldquo;Just
think what it must be never to hold your own
baby like this! Poor Aunt Clay! No wonder
she is hard and cold&mdash;but goodness me, I&rsquo;m glad
I did not draw her for a parent.&rdquo; The baby
looked up into her mother&rsquo;s eyes with a gurgle
and crow, as though she, too, were pleased that
her Granny was as she was and not as Aunt Clay
was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going to see Daddy soon, do you know
that, honey baby?&rdquo; And Molly clasped her rosy
infant to her breast with a heart full of thanksgiving
that now there was no dire reason for her
remaining in Kentucky longer.</p>

<p>A farewell visit must be paid to Aunt Mary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
The baby was dressed in one of her very best
slips and Molly put on her new blue suit for the
occasion, as she well knew how flattered the old
woman was by such an attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, bless Gawd, if here ain&rsquo;t my Molly baby
and the little Miss Milly all dressed up in they
best bibantucker! I been a lyin&rsquo; here a dreamin&rsquo;
you was all back in the carstle, that there apple
tree what you youngsters done built a house up&rsquo;n
an&rsquo; Miss Milly done sent me to say you mus&rsquo; come
an wash yo&rsquo; faceanhans fer dinner, jes&rsquo; lak she
done a millium times, an&rsquo; who should be up in the
tree with you an&rsquo; that there Kent but yo&rsquo; teacher
an&rsquo; that there Judy gal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly laughed as she always did when Aunt
Mary called Professor Edwin Green, her teacher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, chile, they was up there with you an&rsquo;
Kent up&rsquo;n had the imprence to tell me to go tell
his maw that he warn&rsquo;t comin&rsquo; ter no dinner,
&rsquo;cause he an&rsquo; that there Judy gal was a keepin&rsquo;
house up the tree.&rdquo; The old woman chuckled
with delight at Kent&rsquo;s &ldquo;imprence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be astonished if they did go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
housekeeping soon, Aunt Mary, but I don&rsquo;t fancy
it will be up a tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what I done say all the time &rsquo;bout that
there Kent not being drownded? When the niggers
came a whining &rsquo;roun&rsquo; me a sayin&rsquo; he was
sho&rsquo; daid &rsquo;cause they done had signs an&rsquo; omens, I
say ter them I done had mo&rsquo; ter do with that there
Kent than all of &rsquo;em put together an&rsquo; I lak ter
know what they be havin&rsquo; omens &rsquo;bout him when
I ain&rsquo;t had none. If&rsquo;n they was any omens a
floatin&rsquo; &rsquo;roun&rsquo; they would a lit on me an&rsquo; not on
that triflin&rsquo; Buck Jourdan. He say he dream er
teeth an&rsquo; &rsquo;twas sho sign er death. I tell him
mebbeso but &rsquo;twas mo&rsquo;n likely he done overworked
his teeth a eatin&rsquo; er my victuals, a settin&rsquo;
&rsquo;roun&rsquo; here dayanight a strummin&rsquo; on his gittah,
an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s mo&rsquo; I done tole him he better git the
blacksmith ter pull out one er his jaw teeth what
ain&rsquo;t mo&rsquo;n a snaggle. Sukey low she goin&rsquo; ter
send him in ter Lou&rsquo;ville ter one er these here
tooth dentists, but I say the blacksmith is jes&rsquo; as
good a han&rsquo; at drawin&rsquo; teeth as they is, an&rsquo; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
chawge the same as ter shoe a mule, an&rsquo; that ain&rsquo;t
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Aunt Mary, I should think if there is
anything serious the matter with Buck&rsquo;s teeth he
had better see a dentist. The blacksmith might
break his tooth off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who? This here blacksmith? Lawsamussy,
honey, why he&rsquo;s that strong an&rsquo; survigorous that
he would bust Buck&rsquo;s jaw long befo&rsquo; he break his
tooth. He&rsquo;ll grab hol&rsquo; the tooth and put his knee
in Buck&rsquo;s chist an&rsquo; he gonter hol&rsquo; on till either
Buck or the tooth comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A groan from the next room, the lean-to
kitchen, gave evidence that Buck was in there, an
unwilling eavesdropper since the method of the
blacksmith on his suffering molar was the topic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think the baby has grown, Aunt
Mary?&rdquo; asked Molly, mercifully changing the
subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she done growed some an&rsquo; she done
growed prettier. I seed all the time she were
gonter be pretty, an&rsquo; when that there Paul came
down here an&rsquo; give it to me that the new baby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
looked lak a pink mummy&mdash;I done tol&rsquo; him that I
didn&rsquo;t know what a mummy were, but what ever
it were, the new baby didn&rsquo;t look no mo&rsquo; lak one
than he did when he was born, &rsquo;cause of all the
wrinkly, scarlet little Injuns he would a fetched
the cake. That done dried that there Paul up an
he ain&rsquo;t been so bombast since bout the looks er no
new babies.&rdquo; The old woman chuckled with delight
in remembrance of her repartee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Mary, I think you are feeling better,
aren&rsquo;t you? You seem much more lively than
when I saw you last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cose I is feelin&rsquo; better. Ain&rsquo;t we done heard
good news from that there Kent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought you knew all the time he was
all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well now, so I did, so fur as I knew anything,
but they was times when I doubted, an&rsquo; those
times pulled me back right smart. Why, honey,
I used ter pray the Almighty if he lacked a soul
ter jes&rsquo; tak me. I is a no &rsquo;count ole nigger on the
outside but mebbe my soul is some good yit. If I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
could give up my life fur one er Miss Milly&rsquo;s chillun,
I&rsquo;d be proud ter do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Mary, you have been so good to us
always!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lawsamussy, chile! What I here fur but ter
be good ter my white folks? They&rsquo;s been good
ter me&mdash;as good as gole. I ain&rsquo;t never wanted
fur nothin&rsquo; an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t never had a hard word
from Carmichael or Brown, savin&rsquo;, of cose, Miss
Sary. She is spoke some hard words in her day,
but she didn&rsquo; never mean nothin&rsquo; by them words.
I don&rsquo;t bear no grudge against po&rsquo; Miss Sary.
The good Lord done made her a leetle awry an&rsquo;
&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t fur me ter be the one ter try to straighten
her out. Sometimes whin I lies here a thinkin&rsquo; it
seems ter me mebbe some folks is made lak Miss
Sary jes&rsquo; so they kin be angels on earth like yo&rsquo;
maw. Miss Sary done sanctified yo&rsquo; maw. She
done tried her an&rsquo; rubbed aginst her, burnt her in
de fire of renunciation and drinched her in the
waters of reproachment until yo maw is come out
refimed gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you are right, Aunt Mary. I am trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
to be nicer about the way I feel about Aunt
Clay myself. I think if I feel differently, maybe
Aunt Clay would feel differently toward me.
She does not like me, and why should she, since I
don&rsquo;t really like her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want ter take no Christian thoughts
from yo&rsquo; min&rsquo; an&rsquo; heart, honey chile, but the good
you&rsquo;ll git from thinkin&rsquo; kin&rsquo; things &rsquo;bout Miss
Sary will be all yo&rsquo; own good. Miss Sary ain&rsquo;t
gonter be no diffrent. She done got too sot in
her ways. The leper ain&rsquo;t gonter change his
spots now no mo&rsquo;n it did in the time er Noah, certainly
no ole tough leper lak Miss Sary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was hard to tell the old woman good-by.
Every time Molly left Chatsworth she feared it
would be the last farewell to poor old Aunt Mary.
She had been bedridden now for many months,
but she hung on to life with a tenacity that was
astonishing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cose, I is ready ter go whin the Marster
calls,&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;but I ain&rsquo;t a hurryin&rsquo; of
him. A creakin&rsquo; do&rsquo; hangs long on its hinges an&rsquo;
the white folks done iled up my hinges so, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
with good victuals with plenty er suption in &rsquo;em
an&rsquo; a little dram now an&rsquo; then &rsquo;cordin&rsquo; ter the
doctor&rsquo;s subscription, that sometimes I don&rsquo;t
creak at all. I may git up out&rsquo;n this here baid &rsquo;fo
long an&rsquo; be as spry as the nex&rsquo;. I wouldn&rsquo;t min&rsquo;
goin&rsquo; so much if I jes&rsquo; had mo&rsquo; idee what Heaven
is lak. I&rsquo;m so feard it will be strange ter me. I
don&rsquo;t want ter walk on no goldin&rsquo; streets. Gold
ain&rsquo;t no better ter walk on than bricks. Miss
Milly done read me the Psalm what say: &lsquo;He
maketh me to lay down in the green pastures.&rsquo;
Now that there piece sounds mighty pretty&mdash;jes&rsquo;
lak singin&rsquo;, but I ain&rsquo;t never been no han&rsquo; to set
on the damp groun&rsquo; an&rsquo; Heaven or no Heaven, I
low it would give me a misery ter be a doin&rsquo; it
now; an&rsquo; as fer layin&rsquo; on it, no&rsquo;m! I wants a good
rockin&rsquo; cheer, an&rsquo; I wants it in the house, an&rsquo;
when I wants ter res&rsquo; myse&rsquo;f, a baid is good
enough fer me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman&rsquo;s theology was a knotty problem
for all of the Brown family. They would
read to her from the Bible and reason with her,
but her preconceived notion of Heaven was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
much for them. She believed firmly in the
pearly gates and the golden streets, and freely
announced she would rather have her own cabin
duplicated on the other side than all the many
mansions, and her own whitewashed gate with
hinges made from the soles of old shoes than the
pearly gates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I want with a mansion? The cabin
whar I been a livin&rsquo; all my life is plenty good
enough for this old nigger. An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s mo, blue
grass a growin&rsquo; on each side of a shady lane is
better&rsquo;n golden streets. I ain&rsquo;t a goin&rsquo; ter be
hard-headed bout Heaven, but I hope the Marster
will let me settle in some cottage an&rsquo; let it be in
the country where I kin raise a few chickens an&rsquo;
mebbe keep a houndog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure the Master will let you have whatever
you want, dear Aunt Mary,&rdquo; Molly would
say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if&rsquo;n he does that, I&rsquo;ll get too rotten spiled
ter stay in Heaven. He better limit me some, or
I&rsquo;ll feel too proudified even fer a angel.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>WELLINGTON AGAIN.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is nice to be back home,&rdquo; sighed Molly,
settling herself luxuriously in the sleepy-hollow
chair that was supposed to be set aside for the
master of the house. With the girlish habit she
had never outgrown, she slipped off her pumps
and stretched out her slender feet to the wood
fire, that felt very comfortable in the crisp
autumn weather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you said when we arrived in
Kentucky in the spring,&rdquo; teased her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, so it was nice. The migratory birds
have two homes and they are always glad to get
to whichever one is seasonable. I reckon I am
with my two homes as Mother is with her seven
children. I love them just the same. Thank
goodness, I haven&rsquo;t seven of them, homes, I
mean.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think two are enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which home do you love best, Wellington or
the Orchard Home?&rdquo; asked Molly, smiling fondly
at her husband, who was dandling little Mildred
on his knees with awkward eagerness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, neither one of them is home to me unless
you are there, and whichever one you grace
with your presence is for the time being the one I
like the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the baby, too, whichever one she is in
makes it home!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly!&rdquo; exclaimed Edwin Green with
a whimsical expression on his face. &ldquo;I see that
when I make love now it is to be to two ladies and
not to one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think Mildred has grown a lot?
And see, her eyes have really turned brown, just
as Mother said they would. Don&rsquo;t you think she
looks well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, honey, I think she looks very well, but I
don&rsquo;t think you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me! Nonsense! I am as well as can be, just
a little tired from the trip.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. Of course that was fatiguing,
but I think you are thinner than you have any
right to be. I am afraid you have been doing
too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, not at all. I have had simply nothing to
do but take care of the baby, and that is just
play, real play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph, no doubt! But maybe you have
played too hard and that is what has tired you.
I thought you were going to bring Kizzie along
to nurse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was your and Mother&rsquo;s plan! I never
had any idea of doing it. &rsquo;Deed and um&rsquo;s muvver
is going to take care of &rsquo;ittle bits a baby herself,&rdquo;
and Molly reached out and snuggled the willing
Mildred down in the sleepy-hollow chair.
Daddy&rsquo;s knee was not the most comfortable spot
in the world, and a back that has only been in the
world about four months cannot stand for much
dandling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Molly darling, Kizzie is a good girl and
it would help you ever so much to have her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
You know we can well afford it now, so don&rsquo;t let
the financial side of it worry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Edwin, I can&rsquo;t give up taking care of the
baby. I just love to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, my dear, but please don&rsquo;t wear yourself
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fact was that the long strain of waiting
for news from Kent had told on Molly, and she
was looking quite wan and tired. It was not just
the trip from Kentucky, which, of course, was no
easy matter. Twenty-four hours on the train
with an infant that needed much attention and
got much more than it really needed was no joke,
but the long hours and days of waiting and uncertainty
had taken Molly&rsquo;s strength. She did
feel tired and had no appetite, but she felt sure a
night&rsquo;s rest would restore her. She rather attributed
her lack of appetite to the poor food that
the new Irish maid, whom Edwin had installed in
her absence, was serving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take hold of her to-morrow and see what
can be done,&rdquo; she said rather wearily to herself.
&ldquo;I wish Mother could train her for me. I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
much rather do the cooking myself than try to
train some one who is as hopelessly green as this
girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night little Mildred decided was a good
time to assert herself. The trip had not tired
her at all; on the contrary, it had spurred her on
to a state of hilarity, which was very amusing at
first but as the night wore on, ceased to be funny.
She had come to the delightful knowledge of the
fact that she had feet and that each foot had five
toes. The cover did not stay on these little pigs
one moment. Every time Molly would settle her
tired bones and begin to doze, there would be a
crow from Mildred, a gurgle, and straight in the
air would go the bed clothes, tucked in for the
millionth time by the patient young mother.
Then the pink tootsies would leap into sight and
soon find their way to a determined little mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darling, you must go to sleepsumby!&rdquo; Molly
would remonstrate. &ldquo;And you will catch your
death if you don&rsquo;t keep covered up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the four months&rsquo; old baby had been too
busy in her short life learning other things to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
bother her head about a mere language. The
business of the night was feet and feet alone.
There was too much to do about those wonderful
little feet for her to think of sleep. Finally Molly
gave up. She closed the windows, as too much
fresh air on bare feet and legs might not be best
and already the little limbs were icy cold. Then
she kindled a fire in the grate, the furnace not
yet having been started, and gave herself up to a
night of sleeplessness. Early in the action,
Edwin had been banished to the guest chamber,
as he must get sleep no matter what happened,
for he had a busy day ahead of him.</p>

<p>Toward morning little Mildred mastered her
pedagogy, as her father had called it, and then
she dropped off into a deep and peaceful sleep.
The weary Molly slept, too.</p>

<p>Before he went to his lectures, Edwin crept
into the room to look at his sleeping treasures.
The chubby baby still had a toe clasped in her
hand but from very weariness had fallen over on
her side and was covered up all but the pink foot,
which was asserting itself in the remarkable position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
that only the young can take. Molly looked
very pale and tired but was sleeping peacefully.
Edwin smiled at them. He had given the green
maid from the Emerald Isle strict orders not to
awaken them. He devoutly hoped that Molly
would not know what a very mean breakfast he
had endeavored to choke down; burnt bacon and
underdone biscuit washed down with very weak
coffee and flanked by eggs that had been cooked
too long and not long enough, thereby undergoing
that process that the chemist tells us is of all
things the most indigestible: half hard and half
soft. The burnt bacon had been cold and the
underdone biscuit still cooking, seemingly, when
the poor young husband and father had tried to
nourish himself on them.</p>

<p>He had rather hoped when Molly once got back
to Wellington that his food would be better; no
doubt it would as soon as she, poor girl, could get
rested up. He was thankful, indeed, now that
she was asleep and tiptoed out of the room and
house without making a sound.</p>

<p>She slept until late in the morning and then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
business of the day began, getting little Mildred
fed and washed and dressed and fed again and
then to sleep. The good-natured, if wholly incapable,
Katy hung around and waited on the pretty
young mistress. Katy had never been out in service
in the &ldquo;schtates,&rdquo; but had come from New
York in answer to an advertisement in a newspaper
inserted by the despairing professor when
he had come back to Wellington alone while his
wife waited in Kentucky for news of her brother.
He had had kindly visions of getting a good Irish
cook and having the housekeeping all running
beautifully before Molly&rsquo;s return.</p>

<p>Immigrant Katy proved rosy and willing but
with no more conception of how to cook than she
had how to clean. She was great on &ldquo;scroobing,&rdquo;
but walls and furniture and carpets were not supposed
to be scrubbed. The kitchen floor and pantry
shelves were alike beautiful after her administrations,
but gold dust and a stiff brush had not
improved the appearance of the piano legs.
Edwin had come home in the nick of time to stop
her before she vented her energies on Molly&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
own Persian rug, the pride of her heart because
of the wonderful blue in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time is it, Katy?&rdquo; asked Molly after the
baby was absolutely finished and tucked in her
carriage to stay on the porch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis twilve of the clock, Miss, and I haven&rsquo;t
so much as turned a hand below schtairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it can&rsquo;t be that late! Lunch at one!
What are we to have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that I am not knowing, Miss. Sure and
there is nothing in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Katy, and I have been dawdling up here
for hours! I forgot about keeping house, I was
so taken up with the baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and no doubt your man will be sour
about it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly, still in her kimono, flew to the regions
below and began frantically to search for something
to concoct into luncheon. A forlorn piece
of roast veal was excavated and half a loaf of
stale baker&rsquo;s bread. A can of asparagus, a leftover
from the housekeeping of the spring,
was unearthed. Olive oil was in the refrigerator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
also, butter, milk and eggs. The veal
looked very hopeless, evidently having reposed
for hours in a half cold oven before it had furnished
forth a miserable dinner for the poor professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;form a miracle on the vituals,&rsquo; as
dear Aunt Mary would say,&rdquo; declared Molly to
herself. &ldquo;Katy, get the dining room straight.
Don&rsquo;t scrub anything but just clear off the table
and then set it again as well as you can. Put on
a fresh lunch cloth and clean napkins; then see
that the fire in the library is all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The veal, run through the meat chopper, came
out better than was to be expected, and croquettes
were formed and frying in deep fat before the
dazed Katy had cleared off the breakfast table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Katy, you must hurry or we won&rsquo;t have the
master&rsquo;s luncheon ready when he gets in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith, and, Mrs. Green, you do be flying
round so schwift like, that I can&rsquo;t get me breath.
I feel like the wind from your schkirts was sinding
me back. All I can do is schtand schtill and
breast the wind.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I tell you what you do then,&rdquo; laughed
Molly: &ldquo;You come fly with the wind,&rdquo; and she
caught the Irish girl by the hand and ran her
around the dining room table just to show her
how fast she could go if necessary. Katy, having
got wound up, kept on going at a rate of speed
that was astonishing. To be sure, she broke a
cup and a plate, but what was a little chaney to
the master&rsquo;s luncheon being served on time?</p>

<p>The faithful can of asparagus was opened and
heated; toast was made from the half loaf of
stale bread, and a cream sauce prepared to pour
over the asparagus on toast. Popovers were
stirred up and in the oven before Katy got the
table set, although she was going with the wind
instead of trying to breast it. A few rosy apples
from the orchard at Chatsworth, unearthed from
the depths of the unpacked trunk, formed a salad
with a mayonnaise made in such a hurry that
Molly trembled for its quality; but luck being
with her that day, it turned out beautifully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No lettuce, so we&rsquo;ll put the salad on those
green majolica plates and maybe he won&rsquo;t notice,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
she called to Katy, just as the professor
opened the front door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mol&mdash;ly!&rdquo; he called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mistress of the house emerged from the
kitchen in a state of mussiness but looking very
pretty withal, her red-gold hair curling up in little
ringlets from the steam and her cheeks as rosy
as though she had joost come over wid Katy.
Her blue kimono was very becoming but hardly
what she would have chosen to appear in at
luncheon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry not to be dressed, but I had to
hustle so as to get lunch ready in time. The
clock struck twelve when I thought it was about
ten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you have to get luncheon? Where was
Katy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She helped, but I wanted to have a finger in
it. If you will wait a minute, I will get into a
dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you look beautiful in that loose blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
thing; besides, I have to eat and run. A faculty
meeting is calling me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The luncheon was delicious, and Edwin gave it
all praise by devouring large quantities of it.
Molly could not eat much as she was too hot, and
hurrying is not conducive to appetite. Mildred,
who was sleeping on the porch, awoke when the
meal was half over and Molly could not trust
Katy to take her up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She might hold her upside down. I will bring
her to the table and she can talk to you while you
are finishing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Molly flew to the porch and picked up her
darling. She had intended to take her to the
dining room but she remembered it was time for
Mildred to have her food and so the patient
Edwin had to finish his meal alone.</p>

<p>He found his wife and baby on the upper back
porch. The color had left Molly&rsquo;s cheeks and
she was quite pale, and there was a little wan,
wistful look in her countenance that Edwin did
not like.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly, honey, you are all tired out. You did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
not eat your luncheon and you got no sleep last
night. What are we going to do about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right! Please don&rsquo;t bother about
me! Did you like the apple salad? They were
apples from Kentucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine! Everything was delicious. But I
don&rsquo;t want you to wear yourself out cooking. If
Katy can&rsquo;t cook, we must get some one who can.
If she can&rsquo;t cook and you won&rsquo;t let her nurse, why
what is the use of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly, worn out with the sleepless night and
the record breaking getting of a meal out of nothing,
felt as though she would disgrace herself in a
minute and burst into tears. She could not discuss
the matter with Edwin for fear of breaking
down. Edwin kissed her good-by and tactfully
withdrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You goose, Molly Brown!&rdquo; she scolded herself.
&ldquo;And what on earth are you so full of tears
over? I know Edwin thinks I ought to have a
nurse and I just can&rsquo;t trust Mildred to any one.
I am going to try so hard to have everything so
nice that he won&rsquo;t think about it any more.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>A grand telephoning for provisions ensued,
and a dinner was planned for six-thirty that
would have taxed the culinary powers of a real
chef and before which Katy bowed her head in
defeat. It meant that by four Molly must be
back in the kitchen to start things.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>IRISHMAN&rsquo;S CURTAINS.</small></h2>


<p>Callers came in through the afternoon to welcome
back to Wellington the popular wife of the
popular professor and to glimpse the new baby.
Kind Mrs. McLean, the wife of the doctor, a little
older than when last we saw her but showing it
only in her whitening hair and not at all in her
upright carriage and British complexion, stopped
in &ldquo;just for a moment&rdquo; to be picked up later by
the doctor on his way to a country patient. Miss
Walker herself, the busy president of Wellington,
ran in from the meeting of the faculty to greet
her one time pupil and to give one kiss to the college
baby. Several of the seniors, who were
freshmen when Molly was still at college as post
graduate and who had the delight of calling her
Molly while most of the others had to say Mrs.
Green, came in fresh from a game of basketball,
glowing with health and enthusiasm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>While these friends were all gathered about
Molly and the baby, Alice Fern, Edwin Green&rsquo;s
cousin, driving in to Wellington in a very stylish
new electric car, stopped to make a fashionable
call on her law kin. She had never forgiven
Molly for stealing (as she expressed it) Edwin&rsquo;s
affections. She was still Miss Fern, and although
she was possessed of beauty and intelligence,
it was likely that she would remain Miss
Fern. Molly was never very much at her ease
with Alice. She was particularly sensitive to any
feeling of dislike entertained toward her, and
Edwin&rsquo;s cousin always made her feel that she disapproved
of her in some way.</p>

<p>The living room in the broad old red brick
house on the campus, occupied by the professor of
English, was a pleasant room, breathing of the
tastes and pursuits of the owners. Low bookshelves
were in every nook and cranny, filled with
books, the shelves actually sagging with them.
Botticelli&rsquo;s Primavera, a present from Mary
Stewart, adorned one wall; Mathew Jouette&rsquo;s
portrait of Molly&rsquo;s great grandmother, a wedding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
present from Aunt Clay, another. This was the
portrait that looked so much like Molly and also
like the Marquise d&rsquo;Ochtè, between whom and
Aunt Sarah Clay there was no love lost; indeed,
it was this likeness that had induced Aunt Clay
to part with such a valuable work of art. The
other pictures were some dashing, clever sketches
by Judy Kean, and Pierce Kinsella&rsquo;s very lovely
portrait of Mrs. Brown, that had won honorable
mention at the Salon and then had been sent by
the young artist to adorn Molly&rsquo;s home. On
the whole, it was a very satisfactory and tastefully
furnished room and Molly and Edwin always
declared they could talk better and think
better in that room than in any they had ever
seen.</p>

<p>On that first day home, Molly was a little conscious
of the fact that the room needed a thorough
cleaning, not the scrubbing that Katy was
so desirous of administering, but just a good
thorough cleaning. However, she was so glad to
see her friends again and so proud of showing her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
wonderful baby to them that the cleaning seemed
of small importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dust all the books to-morrow,&rdquo; she said
to herself, &ldquo;and have Katy wipe down the walls,
polish the glass on the pictures, and above all,
wash the windows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She well knew that Miss Walker and dear Mrs.
McLean were not noticing such things, or, if they
did, they would make all excuses. As for the college
girls&mdash;dirt was not what they came to see.
They came to see the lovely Molly and her adorable
baby. If the walls were festooned with cobwebs,
why that was the way walls should be in
the home of a learned professor of English, who
had written several books, besides the libretto to
a successful opera, and who was married to a
beautiful Titian-haired girl who was also a genius
in her way, having been accepted in magazines
when she was not even out of college.
What did they care for dust on the books and
smeary window panes? Molly was so popular
with the college girls that in their eyes she was
perfection itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Alice Fern&rsquo;s entrance broke up the cheerful
group gathered around Molly and the rosy Mildred.
Miss Walker suddenly remembered that
she had an important engagement and hurried
off, and Mrs. McLean, who made no endeavor to
hide her impatience at Miss Fern&rsquo;s exceeding
smugness, went outside to wait for the doctor.
The girls stayed, however, hoping to sit out the
unwelcome interrupter.</p>

<p>These girls were favorites of Molly&rsquo;s. The
harum scarum Billie McKym from New York reminded
her in a way of her own Judy, although
no one else could see it. Josephine Crittenden,
Tom boy of college and leader in all sports, hailed
from Kentucky, and being a distant relative of
Crittenden Rutledge, Mildred Brown&rsquo;s husband,
was of course taken immediately under the wing
of the loyal Molly. She had what she called a
crush on Molly, and not a little did she amuse
that young matron, as well as annoy her, by her
gifts of flowers and candy.</p>

<p>The third girl was from the West. Thelma
Olsen was her name, and although her family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
had been in America for three generations,
Thelma had inherited the characteristics of a
Viking maiden along with the name. She was
very tall, with an excellent figure and the
strength of a man. Her hair was as yellow as
gold and her eyes as blue as corn flowers. She
moved with dignity, holding her head up like a
queen. Her expression was calm and kindly.
She had, in very truth, worked her way through
college, which of course appealed to Molly, remembering
well her own boot blacking days and
her many schemes for making a few pennies.
But what most touched our Molly was the fact
that Thelma had a writing bee in her bonnet.
The girl had an instinct for literature and a longing
for expression that must come out. Professor
Green thought very highly of her gift for
prose and did much to encourage her.</p>

<p>These three girls formed a strange trio, but
they were inseparable, having roomed together
since their freshman year. Billie was very rich
in her own name, since she was an orphan with
nothing closer than a guardian and an aunt-in-law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Money meant no more to her than black-eyed
peas. She was intensely affectionate and
where she loved, she loved so fiercely that it positively
hurt, she used to say. She was witty and
clever but not much of a student, as is often the
case where learning comes too easily. She was
so generous it was embarrassing to her friends.
Her talent lay in clothes. She knew more about
clothes than Paquin and Doucet and all the others.
It positively hurt her when her friends did
not wear becoming clothes, just as it hurt her
when she loved them so hard. The object of her
life was to clothe her dear friend Thelma in dark
blue velvet. Thelma was too proud to be clothed
in anything that she had not paid for herself, and
the consequence was that coarse blue serge was
as near as she came to poor Billie&rsquo;s dream.</p>

<p>Alice Fern seated herself on the front of a
chair with very much of a lady-come-to-see expression
and then formally entered into a conversation,
going through the usual questions
about when Molly had arrived and how old the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
baby was, polite inquiries regarding the relatives
in Kentucky, etc.</p>

<p>Molly was eager to get into the kitchen just for
a moment to start Katy on the right track, well
knowing that nothing would be doing until she
did, but Alice Fern&rsquo;s arrival made that impossible.
She would not in the least have minded excusing
herself for a moment to the girls, but if
Edwin Green had to wait until midnight for his
dinner, she could not be guilty of such a breach
of etiquette with the cousin-in-law, whose disapproval
she felt was ever on the alert for a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison
d&rsquo;être</i>. A leg of lamb, and well grown lamb at
that, must have plenty of time and the oven must
be hot (something Katy knew nothing about),
but the wife of Professor Green must not let his
relatives know that she was such a poor manager
as to have to leave the parlor to attend to
cooking at a time in the afternoon when callers
were supposed to be doing their calling.</p>

<p>Alice Fern was really a very pretty young
woman, and since she had nothing to do but attend
to her person, she was always excellently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
well groomed. No blemish was allowed on her
faultless complexion from sun or wind. An hour
a day was religiously given up to massage and
manicure. Her hair was always coiffed in the
latest mode, and not one lock was ever known to
be out of place. Her costume was ever of the
richest and most stylish.</p>

<p>On that afternoon, as she rode up in her closed
electric car, dressed in a fawn-colored suit with
spotless white gloves and spats, she really looked
like a beautiful wax figure in a showcase. Beside
her, poor Molly looked like a rumpled Madonna.
She had on a very becoming blue linen
house dress that she had donned as not only suitable
for possible callers but also not too pure or
good in which to cook her husband&rsquo;s food. The
baby had delighted the admiring audience, before
the arrival of Miss Fern, by clutching a handful
of her mother&rsquo;s pretty hair and having to have
her little pink fingers opened one by one to disengage
them. No doubt it was a highly intelligent
and charming performance, but it had played sad
havoc with Molly&rsquo;s hair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We are so glad you are back, Molly, for more
reasons than one,&rdquo; exclaimed Jo Crittenden, hoping
to loosen the tension a little, when Alice had
completed her perfunctory catechism. &ldquo;When
are you going to begin the Would-be Authors&rsquo;
Club?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do begin soon!&rdquo; begged Billie. &ldquo;Thelma
has turned out some scrumptious bits during vacation,
and even I have busted loose on paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have written a lot this summer,&rdquo; said
Thelma, as Molly smiled on her. &ldquo;Have you
done anything, or has the baby kept you too
busy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I had plenty of time while I was in Kentucky.
You see, out there I have a very good
servant and then my mother helps me with Mildred.
I have finished a short story and sent it
off. Of course, I am expecting it back by every
mail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think your household cares would
prevent your giving much time to scribbling,&rdquo;
sniffed Alice, if one could call the utterances of
such an elegant dame sniffing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Scribbling! Why, Mrs. Green has written
real things and been in real magazines,&rdquo; stormed
Billie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if we had not limited the Would-be
Authors to twenty, we would have the whole of
Wellington clamoring to join,&rdquo; declared Jo, who
considered it was high time for a perfect gentleman
to step in and let Miss Alice Fern know how
Wellington felt toward Mrs. Edwin Green.</p>

<p>Miss Fern said nothing but stared at the corner
of the room that Edwin and Molly called:
&ldquo;The Poet&rsquo;s Corner.&rdquo; It was where all the
poetry, ancient, medieval and modern, found shelf
room. Over it hung Shakespeare&rsquo;s epitaph, a
framed rubbing from the tomb, the same that
Edwin had always kept over his desk in his
bachelor days to scare his housekeeper, Mrs.
Brady, into sparing his precious papers.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Good frend for Isus sake forbeare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To digg ye dust encloased heare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bleste be ye man yt spares thes stones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And curst be he yt moves my bones.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>She kept her eyes so glued to the spot over the
book shelves that finally all turned involuntarily
to see what she was gazing on so intently. There
it hung! There was no denying it or overlooking
it: a great black cobweb that must have been
there for several generations of spiders. No
doubt it had taken all summer to weave such a
mighty web and catch and hold so much grime.</p>

<p>Molly blushed furiously. For a moment, she
almost hated Katy and she wholly hated Alice
Fern. That elegant damsel had a supercilious expression
on her aristocratic countenance that said
as plainly as though she had given utterance to
her thoughts:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Author&rsquo;s Club, indeed! She had much better
clean her house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly was suddenly conscious that every corner
was festooned with similar webs. The late
afternoon sun was slanting in the windows and
its searching rays had found and were showing
up every grain of dust. The panes of glass were,
to say the least, grimy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it was so&mdash;so&mdash;dusty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
in here. Katy, the new maid, was
supposed to have cleaned it before I came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you care for a few Irishman&rsquo;s curtains?&rdquo;
said the hero-worshipping Billie. &ldquo;No
one noticed them until&mdash;ahem&mdash;until the sun
came in the window.&rdquo; She <em>said</em> sun came in the
window but she plainly <em>meant</em> Fern came in the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had time to do much housekeeping
since I got back,&rdquo; continued Molly, lamely. &ldquo;The
new maid, Katy, that Edwin got from New York,
is most inefficient but so good-natured that I am
hoping to train her. The truth of the matter is
that she and I spent the whole morning doing
things for Mildred and we let the house go. I
am going to have a big cleaning to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly felt like weeping with mortification and
she began to hate herself for making explanations
and excuses to Alice Fern. Even if she kept
Professor Green&rsquo;s house festooned in cobwebs
from attic to cellar and had dust over everything
thick enough to write your name, what business
was it of this perfect person? She suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
realized, too, that that perfect person had never
uttered a word although she had looked volumes.</p>

<p>Miss Fern arose from her prim seat and made
a rather hasty retreat. The relieved Molly excused
herself to the girls and rushed to the
kitchen to start Katy on the dinner that should
have been on half an hour before. What was
her chagrin to find the fire only just kindled, as
Katy had let it go out so that she might polish
the stove. The Irish girl was on her knees
&ldquo;scroobing,&rdquo; happy in a sea of soap suds.</p>

<p>Molly almost had hysterics. How could she
ever get things done? Edwin would be home any
moment now and she could not stand having a
miserable underdone dinner for him, nor could
she stand having his dinner hours late. She
realized that there was no use in reprimanding
Katy,&mdash;the girl was simply ignorant. She asked
her gently to postpone her &ldquo;scroobing&rdquo; until
later and to wash her hands and prepare the
vegetables. Then she piled kindling wood in the
range until the chimney roared so that Katy said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
it sounded like a banshee. The oven must be hot
for the roast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you what to do, Katy: make some tea
immediately and slice some bread quite thin, open
this box of peanut cookies, and we will have such
a grand tea that the master won&rsquo;t be hungry until
the roast is done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And phwat a schmart trick!&rdquo; laughed the girl.</p>

<p>When Miss Fern made her adieux, Molly had
flown so quickly to the kitchen that she had not
seen her husband crossing the campus. Alice
Fern had seen him, however, and her greeting of
him was so warm and friendly, her smile so
charming and her manner so cordial that she
hardly seemed the same person who had just left
poor Molly stuttering and stammering apologies
over her Irishman&rsquo;s curtains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at the pill!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo. &ldquo;She is
about to eat up Epiménides Antinous Green.&rdquo;
That was the name Professor Green was known
by at Wellington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see any one cast such a damper
over a crowd without saying a single word? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
thought Molly was going to cry,&rdquo; declared
Billie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think our friend is looking very tired,&rdquo; said
Thelma. &ldquo;I wish we could do something for her.
She says this new maid is almost worse than
none at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a scheme!&rdquo; squealed Billie. &ldquo;I know
of a way to help. Gather &rsquo;round me, girls!&rdquo;
And then such another whispering as went on in
the house&mdash;while Molly behaved like triplets in
the kitchen, being in at least three places at one
time in her determination to get dinner on the
stove. Mildred lay on the divan, happy with her
newly found toes, and Edwin helped Alice Fern
into her glass show case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I appreciate your coming to see my wife so
soon, Alice. I should so like to have you and
Molly be close friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Edwin, I am sure nothing would
please me more. You must bring Molly out to
see us.&rdquo; Could this be the same person who had
made the living room look so dusty and ill kempt
only a few minutes before, this gracious, charming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
sweet, friendly creature, who doted on babies?
She had paid no attention to Mildred except
to give her a tentative poke with her daintily
gloved finger, but to hear her conversation with
Edwin, one would have gathered that she was a
supreme lover of children.</p>

<p>The girls would not stay to tea, although Molly
pressed them, but full of some scheme, they hurried
off.</p>

<p>Dinner was not so very late, after all, and the
tea and bread and peanut cookies saw to it that
the professor was not too hungry before the leg
of lamb had reached the proper stage of serving.
Molly was too much of a culinary artist not to
feel elated when things turned out right, which
they usually did if she could get her finger in the
pie. The day had been a very trying one for her.
The sleepless night had left her little strength to
grapple with it and the slow stupidity of Katy
was very irritating. It was over at last, however,
and dear little Mildred had decided to let
her pigs rest and had gone quietly to sleep at the
proper time that a well-trained infant should.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Edwin was smoking his after-dinner pipe and
everything was very peaceful and pleasant.
Molly was trying to keep her eyes open, ashamed
to confess that she was so sleepy she could hardly
see.</p>

<p>She lay back in the easy chair while Edwin
read aloud from his scrap book of fugitive verse.
This scrap book Professor Green had started
when he was in college, putting in only the rare,
fine things he found in magazine reading. Molly
had helped him in his collecting and now the volume
was assuming vast proportions.</p>

<p>Suddenly Molly&rsquo;s upturned eyes rested on the
terrible cobweb that had been her Waterloo of the
afternoon. How black and threatening it looked!
She hoped Edwin would not see it. And the
books! Actually you had to open one and beat it
and blow it before you dared begin to read. All
this must be cleaned to-morrow and oh, how tired
she was!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did not Alice look lovely this afternoon?&rdquo;
said Edwin, stopping his reading for a moment.
&ldquo;I hope you and she are going to be great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
friends. I think it was very nice for her to come
so soon to call on you. She spoke so sweetly of
the baby, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly said nothing but gazed at the cobweb.
She said nothing but she did some thinking:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly Brown, what right have you, just because
you are tired and Alice Fern came to call
on you, looking very pretty and very beautifully
dressed, and found you all frumpy and your living
room looking like a pig sty, what right have
you, I say, to sulk? Now you answer your husband
and tell him Alice was pretty and don&rsquo;t tell
him anything else.&rdquo; Accordingly, after giving
herself the mental chastisement, Molly emitted a
faint:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, very pretty!&rdquo; But it was so faint and
so far away that Edwin looked at her in alarm,
and then it was that she could stand nothing more
and broke down and shed a few tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Molly, my dearest girl, what is the
matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, but I am tired and everything is so
dirty. Look at the cobwebs! Look at the dust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
on the books! Look at me! I am an old frowsy,
untidy frump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You! Why, honey, you are always lovely.
As for dust&mdash;don&rsquo;t bother about that. Let me
read you this wonderful little poem by Gertrude
Hall. I clipped it years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Green saw that Molly was tired and
unstrung and he well knew that nothing soothed
her more than poetry. Of course, man-like, he
had no idea that what he had said about Alice
Fern&rsquo;s looking so sweet had been too much for
her, as she had contrasted herself all the afternoon
with her husband&rsquo;s immaculate cousin.
Molly wiped away the foolish tears as Edwin
read the poem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is lovely, exquisite!&rdquo; breathed Molly. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t feel nearly so bad about it as I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she did wish that Alice Fern had not seen
that black, black cobweb.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>HEROES AND HERO WORSHIPERS.</small></h2>


<p>The next morning poor Molly slept late again.
With all good intentions of waking early and going
down stairs in time to see about her husband&rsquo;s
neglected breakfast, when morning came she did
not stir. Mildred had given her another wakeful
night after all, finding out more things about
her little pigs. Finally the little monkey had
given up and dropped off to sleep, and she and her
doting mother were both dead to the world when
the time came for Professor Green to go to
lectures.</p>

<p>Again he gave instructions to Katy not to disturb
the mistress and crept out of the house as
still as a mouse. Breakfast had been a little better.
Molly was rubbing off on Katy evidently.
Just to associate with such a culinary genius as
Molly must have its effect even on the worst cook
in the world, which Katy surely seemed to be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Coming across the campus, he ran into Billie
McKym, Josephine Crittenden and Thelma
Olsen. They looked very bright and rosy as they
gave him a cheery good morning. Each carried
a bundle. He wondered that they were going
away from lecture halls instead of toward them.
But after all, it was not his business to be the
whipper-in for lectures. Wellington was a college
and not a boarding school. If students chose
to cut lectures, it was their own affair until the
final reckoning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just our luck to meet Epiménides Antinous!&rdquo;
cried Billie. &ldquo;He should have been out of the
house five minutes ago, at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His legs are so long he doesn&rsquo;t have to start
early,&rdquo; declared Jo. &ldquo;Just see him sprint!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am certainly sorry to cut his lecture to-day,&rdquo;
sighed Thelma, &ldquo;but this thing must be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Greens&rsquo; front door was never locked except
at night, so the girls crept quietly in. Billie
peeped into the kitchen, where she discovered
Katy on her knees &ldquo;scroobing&rdquo; the part of the
kitchen she could not finish the evening before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
when Molly was so hard-hearted as to make her
stop and prepare vegetables. Such a sea of
suds!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Katy,&rdquo; whispered Billie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merciful Mither! And phwat is it? Ye scart
me,&rdquo; and the girl sat back on her heels and looked
at Billie with round, wide eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are great friends of Mrs. Green and we
have come to dust her books and&mdash;ahem&mdash;do a
few little things. Is she still asleep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yis, and the master was after saying she must
not be distoorbed, not on no account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she must not be! That is why we
have come to dust the things. We think she
looks so tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so she is, the scwate lamb; but she do fly
around so, and she do cook up so mooch. I tell
her that she thinks more of her man&rsquo;s insides thin
she do of her own outsides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Katy, we want you to let us have a
broom and a wall brush. We brought our own
aprons and rags,&rdquo; and Billie pressed a round,
hard something into Katy&rsquo;s hand. It was not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
large as a church door nor so deep as a well, but
it served to get the Irish girl up off of her run-down
heels; and in a trice the coveted broom and
wall brush were in possession of the three conspirators,
as well as a stepladder, which they decided
would be needful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say a word to Mrs. Green, Katy,&mdash;now
remember. We are going to work very quietly
and hope to finish before she gets downstairs.
We don&rsquo;t want her to know who did it, but we
mean to get it all done before noon,&rdquo; said Jo, rolling
up her sport shirtsleeves and disclosing muscular
arms, that showed what athletics had done
for her and what she could do for athletics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where must we begin, Thelma?&rdquo; asked Billie,
who was as willing as could be but knew no more
about cleaning than a hog does about holidays, Jo
declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begin at the top,&rdquo; laughed Thelma, tying up
her yellow head in a great towel and rolling up
her sleeves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, your arms are beautiful!&rdquo; exclaimed Billie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give my head for such arms. I&rsquo;d like
to drape them in a silver scarf. Think how they
would gleam through.&rdquo; The arms were snow
white and while Thelma&rsquo;s strength was much
greater than Jo&rsquo;s, her muscles did not show as
they did on that athletic young person.</p>

<p>Thelma blushed and laughed as she balanced
herself on a stepladder and began taking down
pictures. A cloud of dust floated down and enveloped
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, look! She looks like the &lsquo;white armed
Gudrun&rsquo;! Don&rsquo;t you remember in William
Morris&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fall of the Neiblungs&rsquo;? The battle in
Atli&rsquo;s Hall?</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;Lo, lo, in the hall of the Murder where the
white-armed Gudrun stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloft by the kingly high-seat, and nought
empty are her hands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the litten brand she beareth, and the grinded
war-sword bare:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still she stands for a little season till day groweth
white and fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without the garth of King Atli, but within, a
wavering cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolls, hiding the roof and the roof-sun; then she
stirrith and crieth aloud.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut it out! Cut it out!&rdquo; cried Jo, &ldquo;and come
lend a hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t we dust before we sweep?&rdquo; innocently
asked Billie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want to, but you&rsquo;ll have to dust again
afterwards,&rdquo; said the white-armed Gudrun from
her ladder. &ldquo;The books are really so dirty that
I don&rsquo;t think it would hurt to wipe down the walls
without covering them, but that is a mighty poor
cleaning method. Poor Molly! Didn&rsquo;t she look
tired yesterday? I hope she won&rsquo;t think we are
cheeky to take a hand in her affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheeky! She will think we are her good
friends, not like that snippy Miss Fern who
stared so at the cobwebs and then went out and
palavered over Epiménides Antinous. She used
to claim him, so I am told. One of the nurses at
the infirmary told me that when Epi Anti had
typhoid there, years ago, Miss Fern came and
dressed herself up like a nurse and almost bored
the staff to death taking care of her sick cousin,&rdquo;
said Billie, delighted with the job that had been
given her of wiping down walls. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
splendid? Just look at all the dirt I got on my
rag!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t rub it back on the wall,&rdquo; admonished
Jo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Well, what must I do with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say, but don&rsquo;t put it back on the
walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jo, you and Billie dust the books and I will
finish up the pictures. I can&rsquo;t trust myself to
dust Professor Green&rsquo;s books. I am afraid of
breaking the tenth commandment all the time,&rdquo;
sighed Thelma. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wash the windows, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Thelma! The white-armed Gudrun sitting
in windows washing them! That&rsquo;s not occupation
meet for a queen. Let me do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Billie McKym, wash a window! Did
you ever wash one in your life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no, not exactly, but I bet I could.
What&rsquo;s the use of a college education if one can&rsquo;t
wash windows when she gets to be a full grown
senior?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But since the object of the girls was to get the
room clean, it was decided that Thelma was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
wash the windows. My, how they worked! Jo
found she had muscles that her athletics had
never revealed. She found them because they
began to ache.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, to dust all these books and books is as
bad as building a house,&rdquo; she said, straightening
up and stretching when she had finished the
poet&rsquo;s corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly like laying brick,&rdquo; declared Billie.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to join the Hod-carriers&rsquo; Union. I&rsquo;ll
be no scab.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katy had occasionally poked her head in at the
door, entreating &ldquo;whin they coom to the scroobing&rdquo;
to call her.</p>

<p>The cleaners made very little noise, so little
that the sleeping Molly and Mildred were not at
all disturbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish she knew it was almost done,&rdquo; said
Thelma, perched in the window sill and rubbing
vigorously on a shining pane. &ldquo;She would be so
glad. I know she is worrying about it in her
sleep. Hark! There is the baby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then began the business of the day upstairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Katy was called, for water must be heated as
Katy, according to her habit, had let the fire go
out before the boiler was hot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Katy, we must hurry up with Mildred this
morning and get to the library. It is filthy,&rdquo; said
Molly, as she slipped the little French flannel petticoat
over Mildred&rsquo;s bald head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mum!&rdquo; grinned Katy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have luncheon almost ready, with the cold
lamb to start with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you could get the dining room
cleaned while I am attending to the baby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mum, if yez can schpare me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think I can. But, Katy, before you go
hand me that basket. And, Katy, perhaps you
had better wash out this flannel skirt. I am so
afraid she might run short of them. You can
empty the water now&mdash;and, Katy, please hold the
baby&rsquo;s hand while I tie this ribbon, she is such a
wiggler&mdash;and, Katy&mdash;a little boiled water now
for her morning tipple. She must drink lots of
water to keep in good health.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mum, and how aboot breakfast for yez,
mum?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot my breakfast! Of course I must
eat some breakfast. I&rsquo;ll come down to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, mum! And let me be after bringing
it oop to yez, mum,&rdquo; insisted the wily Katy, who
was anxious for the youthful house cleaners to
accomplish their dark and secret mission without
interruption. Not only was it great fun, a huge
joke, in fact, for her to be paid fifty cents to let
others do her work, but it meant that since others
were doing it, she would not have to, and she
could have just that much more time for &ldquo;scroobing&rdquo;
and resting. A tray was accordingly got
ready and Molly found she had a little more
appetite than the morning before; also, that
Katy&rsquo;s food was really a little better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your coffee is better this morning, Katy,&rdquo; she
said, believing that praise for feats accomplished
but egged on the servitor to other and greater
effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mum, so the master said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Edwin,&rdquo; thought Molly, &ldquo;how I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
neglected him. I must do better. But if I don&rsquo;t
wake up, I don&rsquo;t wake up. If I could only get a
little nap in the day time. Mother always
wanted me to take one, but how can I? The living
room must be cleaned to-day.&rdquo; She felt
weary at the thought. Accustomed as she was to
being out of doors a great deal, she really needed
the fresh air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as luncheon is over, we must get busy
with the cleaning. I wish we might have done it
in the forenoon, but I am afraid it is too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mum, it&rsquo;s too late!&rdquo; and Katy indulged
in such a hearty giggle that her mistress began
to think perhaps she was feeble-minded as well
as inefficient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the table in the dining room cleared off,
Katy, so you can set it for luncheon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mum, it is not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Katy! What have you been doing all
morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mum, I scroobed my kitchen, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what?&rdquo; demanded Molly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And I did a little head work in the liberry,
that is, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Katy, did you clean the living room, clean
it well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mum, yez can wait and see if it schoots
yez,&rdquo; and Katy beat a hasty retreat to warn the
cleaners that the mistress was about to descend.</p>

<p>The room presented a very different appearance
to what it had before the girls rolled up
their sleeves. The slanting afternoon sun would
seek out no dusty corners now; everything was
spick and span. The books no longer had to
be beaten and blown before you dared open them,
and they stood in neat and orderly rows; the
walls held no decorations in the shape of Irishman&rsquo;s
curtains now; the picture glass shone, as
did the window panes; the rugs were out in the
back yard sunning after a vigorous beating and
brushing from Thelma, whom Billie called &ldquo;the
powerful Katrinka.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The floor, being the one part of the room that
Katy had put some licks on, did not need anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
more serious than a dusting after everything
else was done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Katy, you might bring in the rugs now as
we have done everything else,&rdquo; suggested Billie.
Katy went out into the back yard and bundled
up the rugs. Molly, seeing her from an upper
window, smiled her approval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe she is going to do very well,&rdquo; she
said to herself. &ldquo;She seems to be trying, and
she is so fond of Mildred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, girls, we must hurry and get off!
Molly will be down stairs any minute now and
she must not see us,&rdquo; and Thelma unwound the
towel from her head and took off her apron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, surely the white-armed Gudrun is not
going across the campus with a black face,&rdquo; objected
Billie. &ldquo;Why, both of you look like negro
minstrels&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you!&rdquo; interrupted Jo. &ldquo;You should see
yourself before you talk about kettles. You&rsquo;d
have not a leg to stand on and not a handle to
your name. I told you to tie up your head. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
believe nothing short of a shampoo and a Turkish
bath will get the grime off you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hide behind the sofa and after Molly
goes on the porch with the baby, we can sneak up
to the bath room,&rdquo; suggested Thelma. The girls
then crouched on the floor behind a sofa that
stood near the poet&rsquo;s corner.</p>

<p>In a minute Molly came down the stairs, little
Mildred in her arms and on her face a contented
and rested expression. She stood in the doorway
of the living room and exclaimed with delight
over its polished cleanliness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Katy, how splendid it is! Did you do
it all by yourself and in such a short time? I
don&rsquo;t see how you managed it. Why, you have
even dusted the books. That is almost a day&rsquo;s
work in itself. I was dreading it so,&mdash;it is such
a back breaking job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jo rubbed her aching back, with a grim smile,
and nudged Billie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you have kept yourself so clean, too!&rdquo;
Molly began to feel that she had the prize servant
of the east: one who could clean such an Augean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Stable as that room had looked, dust all the books,
wash the windows and wipe down walls, beat
rugs, polish picture glass, etc., etc., and still be
neat and tidy. &ldquo;Why, I would have been black
all over if I had done such a great work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katy stood by, quite delighted with the undeserved
praise. The young ladies had told her
not to tell and far be it from her to refuse to accept
the unaccustomed praise from any one. She
had never been very apt in any work she had
undertaken and no one had ever taken any great
pains to teach her, and now if this pretty lady
wanted to praise her, why she was more than willing.
She felt in her pocket for her fifty cent
piece, that still seemed a great joke to her. The
sweet taste of the praise did one great thing in
her kindly Irish soul: it was so pleasant, she determined
to have more of it, and through her
slow intelligence there filtered the fact that to get
more praise, she must deserve more praise, and
to deserve it she must work for it. She beat a
hasty retreat to the dining room and actually
cleared off the table, where the master had eaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
his solitary breakfast, in a full run. She broke
no dishes that morning, either, which was a great
step forward.</p>

<p>Molly could not tear herself away from the
wonder room. She moved around, busying herself
changing ornaments a bit and placing chairs
at a slightly different angle, doing those little
things that make a room partake of a certain
personality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, baby, lie on the sofa, honey. Muddy
is going to give you a little ride. Do you know,
darling, that Katy knows how to put things in
place just like a lady? She must have an artistic
soul. Look how she has arranged the
mantel-piece! Servants usually make things look
so stiff. Actually there is nothing for me to
do in the room, she has done it so beautifully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billy here dug an elbow into Jo&rsquo;s lame back
that almost made her squeal, but she held on to
her emotions and in turn gave her chum a fourth
degree pinch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Muddy is going to ride her baby&mdash;this
sofa must go closer to the wall,&rdquo; and Molly put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Mildred on the sofa and gave it a vigorous push.
The law of impenetrability, that two things cannot
be in the same place at the same time, prevented
the baby from having much of a ride.
Molly gave a harder push. &ldquo;I must be very feeble
if I can&rsquo;t budge this sofa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then came a smothered groan from the huddled
girls, and <a href="#frontispiece">one by one they emerged from
their corner</a>, clutching their bundles of dust rags
and aprons and exposing to Molly&rsquo;s amazed eyes
three of the very blackest, dirtiest faces that ever
Wellington had boasted in her senior class.</p>

<p>They sat on the floor and laughed and giggled,
and Molly sat down beside them and would
have felt like a college girl again herself if it
had not been for little Mildred, who took all the
laughter as an entertainment, got up for her
express amusement, and gurgled accordingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you must all stay to luncheon!&rdquo; cried
the hospitable Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed we mustn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Billie, who never
could quite get used to Molly&rsquo;s wholesale hospitality,
having been brought up in the lap of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
luxury but with no privileges of inviting persons
off hand to meals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must. I won&rsquo;t do a thing for you
but just put on more plates. I was going to
have the very simplest meal and I&rsquo;ll still have
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls stayed, after giving themselves a
vigorous scrubbing, and Molly&rsquo;s luncheon was
ready when Professor Green arrived. The cold
leg of lamb played a noble part at the impromptu
party, flanked by a lettuce salad that Billie insisted
upon dressing, reminding Molly more than
ever of her darling Judy. A barrel of preserves
had just arrived, some that Molly and Kizzie
had put up during the summer. On opening it,
a jar of blackberry jam, being on top, was chosen
to grace the occasion. Molly made some of the
tiny biscuit that her husband loved and that
seemed such a joke to Katy. When she came in
bearing a plate of hot ones, she spread her mouth
in a grin so broad that Professor Green declared
she could easily have disposed of six at one
mouthful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I always call them Gulliver biscuit,&rdquo; he said,
helping himself to three at a time, &ldquo;because in
the old Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels I used to read when
I was a kid there was a picture of Gulliver being
fed by the Lilliputians. He was represented
by a great head, and the Lilliputians were climbing
up his face by ladders and pouring down his
throat barrels of little biscuit that were just about
the size of these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had a merry time at that meal. Molly
told her husband why his prize pupils had cut
his lectures and all others that morning, and how
she had almost passed a steam roller over them
in form of the library sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were terribly afraid we would offend
her,&rdquo; explained Thelma, &ldquo;but she was dear to
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Offend me! Why, I can&rsquo;t think of anything
in all my life that has ever happened to me that
has touched me more. I don&rsquo;t see how you ever
thought of doing anything so nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas Billie,&rdquo; from Thelma.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Thelma and Jo did all the dirty work,&rdquo; declared
Billie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dirty work, indeed! You looked as though
you had used yourself to wipe down the walls
with,&rdquo; laughed Jo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow, when that snippy Miss Fern
comes again, giving her perfunctory pokes at the
baby and looking at the cobwebs until nobody
can help seeing them, I bet she won&rsquo;t find anything
to turn up her nose at. I&rsquo;d like to use her
to clean the walls with. If there is anything I
hate it is any one who is the pink of perfection
in her own eyes. We were having such a cozy
time until she lit on us with her dove-colored effects.
Who cared whether there were cobwebs
or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Miss Fern speak of the cobwebs?&rdquo;
asked Edwin, while the others sat around in
frozen horror, remembering that she was his
cousin and that he was evidently very fond of
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, she didn&rsquo;t open her lips; she just
pursed them up and stared at the corner. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
course, she had already given her dig about
Molly&rsquo;s surely not having time to write and attend
to her house, too; and then when she fixed
her eyes on that Irishman&rsquo;s curtain we all knew
what she was thinking, and that she wanted us
to know it, just as well as though she had spoken
it and then written it and then had it put on the
minutes.&hellip; What&rsquo;s the matter?&hellip; Oh,
Heavens! What have I done?&hellip; Oh, Professor
Green! She is your cousin! Please, please
forgive me,&rdquo; and Billie clasped her hands in
entreaty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t mind me,&rdquo; said the professor with
a twinkle. &ldquo;Go as far as you like. If the ladies
have such open minds that he who runs may
read, and they think disagreeable things about
my wife, why, they deserve to be used for house
cleaning purposes, have the floor wiped up with
them and what not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The luncheon broke up in a laugh and evidently
there were no hard feelings on the part
of the host for the criticism of Miss Fern that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
had so ingenuously fallen from the lips of the
irrepressible Billie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Billie! What a break!&rdquo; screamed Jo, when
they got outside after Molly had given them all
an extra hug for the undying proof of friendship
they had given her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Break, indeed! I never forgot for an instant
that Epi Anti was a near cousin to that maidenhair
fern. I just thought I&rsquo;d let him know how
she had acted and how uncomfortable she had
made our Molly feel. I knew Molly would never
let him know, and I could do it and make out it
was a break.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you aren&rsquo;t like Bret Harte&rsquo;s heathen
Chinee, I never saw one,&rdquo; laughed Thelma.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;Which I wish to remark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my language is plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That for ways that are dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for tricks that are vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heathen Chinee is peculiar.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;All the same, I bet old Epi Anti doesn&rsquo;t tell
Molly any more what a sweet thing Alice Fern
is.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know he did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Insight into human nature,&rdquo; and Billie made
a saucy moue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, my back aches!&rdquo; said Jo. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll
do housework often. It certainly does reach
muscles we don&rsquo;t know about. But didn&rsquo;t it pay
just to see dear old Molly&rsquo;s face when we rolled
out from behind the sofa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And all of them agreed it had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edwin,&rdquo; said Molly, after the girls had gone,
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll send for Kizzie to come help me. I
may put her in the kitchen and take Katy for a
nurse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! I am certainly glad you have come
to that decision. What changed you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems to me that when it comes
to the pass that my college girls feel so sorry
for me they cut such lectures as yours to
give the whole morning to cleaning up for
me I must do something, and the only thing
I can think of doing is to send for Kizzie.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you mix the black and white without coming
to grief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, Katy is more green than white,
and she is so good-natured, she could get along
with anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how relieved I am, honey. I
wanted you to do what pleased you, but I could
not see how I was coming in on this. I felt
very lonesome, and while I wasn&rsquo;t jealous of the
baby, I was certainly envious of her. If Kizzie
comes, you can be with me more and nurse me
some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dearie, I missed it, too, but somehow I
couldn&rsquo;t get through. If Katy had been more
competent&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she wasn&rsquo;t and isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she certainly isn&rsquo;t, but she adores Mildred
already and Mildred actually cries for her. I
believe she would make a fine nurse. If only she
doesn&rsquo;t feel called upon to scrub the baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edwin laughed and, settling himself for a
pleasant smoke, opened the morning paper, which
neither he nor Molly had found time to read.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a shame!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;The Germans
dropping bombs on Paris! Infamous!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paris! How can they? Oh, Edwin, Judy and
Kent both there!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.</small></h2>


<p>When the teller of a tale has to fly from one
side of the ocean to the other in the twinkling
of an eye, as it were, at any rate between chapters,
and the persons in the tale have no communication
with one another except by letters
that are more than likely to be tampered with
on the high seas, it is a great comfort to find
that all the characters have at last arrived at the
same date. On that morning after the dropping
of bombs when Judy, dressed in her sad mourning
garb, was selling spinach and tarts to the
hungry occupants of the Montparnasse quarter,
Molly, allowing for the difference in time, was
oversleeping herself after a wakeful night and
the college girls were quietly cleaning her living
room. Kent and Jim Castleman were stretching
themselves luxuriously in the not too comfortable
beds of the <cite>Haute Loire</cite> preparatory to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
making themselves presentable, first to find Judy,
and then to find the general who, no doubt, would
be glad to have the Kentucky giant enlist in the
ranks, even though his letter of introduction and
credentials had gone to the bottom with the
<cite>Hirondelle de Mer</cite>. Jim Castleman&rsquo;s appearance
was certainly credential enough that he would
make a good fighter.</p>

<p>A bath and a shave did much towards making
our young men presentable. Kent with a
needle and thread, borrowed from the chambermaid,
darned the knees of his trousers so that
they did very well just so long as he did not try
to sit down; then the strain would have been too
much. Jim&rsquo;s were hopelessly short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a flounce would save me, so I&rsquo;ll
have to go around at high water mark; but I&rsquo;ll
soon be in a uniform, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had breakfast in a little café where Kent
had often gone while he was a student at the
Beaux Arts, and there Jim Castleman astonished
the madame by ordering four eggs. She
couldn&rsquo;t believe it possible that any one could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
eat that much <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</i> and so cooked his eggs
four minutes. His French was quite sketchy but
he plunged manfully in with what he had and
finally came out with breakfast enough to last
until luncheon. Kent was willing to do the talking
for him but he would none of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me do it myself! I&rsquo;ll learn how to get
something to eat if I starve in the attempt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now for Judy! Kent could hardly wait
for his famished friend to eat his two orders of
rolls and coffee and his four eggs, but at last
he was through.</p>

<p>First to the bank! No, they did not know
where Mlle. Kean was. She had been in once
to get money but they were sorry they could not
honour her letter of credit. She had left no
address.</p>

<p>Then to the American Club! Judy had been
in the day before for mail, and had had quite a
budget. She had left no address, but came for
letters always when the American mail was reported
in.</p>

<p>Where could she be?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Next, to his cousin, the Marquise d&rsquo;Ochtè, on
the Faubourg!</p>

<p>The venerable porter, at the porte-cochère, who
came in answer to the vigorous ring that the
now very uneasy Kent gave the bell, said that
none of the family was within and they had
no visitor. Madame the Marquise had gone to
the front only the day before, but was coming
home soon to open a hospital in her own home.
Even then the workmen were busy carrying out
her orders, packing away books, pictures, ornaments,
rugs and what not so that the house would
be the more suitable to care for the wounded.
The Marquis and Philippe were both with their
regiments. The old porter was sad and miserable.
Jules, the butler, was gone; also Gaston,
the chef whose sauces were beyond compare.
Madame had taken great hampers of food with
her, even going to Montparnasse for tarts from
Tricots&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Kent turned sadly away. Judy was somewhere,
but where? Her letter to Molly telling
of her being in the Bents&rsquo; studio had come after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Kent left Kentucky and he had no way of knowing
that she was there. Polly Perkins and his
wife, he knew were in the thick of the battle from
the first letter he had seen from Judy. Where
was Pierce Kinsella? He had not heard from his
studio mate and friend but he rather thought
there was little chance of finding him. At any
rate, he determined to go to the Rue Brea and
see if the concierge there knew anything of the
lost damsel.</p>

<p>They found a crowd at the entrance to the
court on which the studios fronted. The concierge
in the midst of them was waving her arms
and talking excitedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the first I heard was a click! click!
click! and that, it seems, was the terrible thing
flying over us and then an explosion that deafened
me. They say it was meant for the Luxembourg
and they missed their mark. That I know
nothing about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it? Tell me quick!&rdquo; demanded Kent,
elbowing his way through the crowd with the
help of Jim, that renowned center rush.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Monsieur Brune!&rdquo; she exclaimed, grasping
his hand. &ldquo;Did you know that a dirty Prussian
had sent a bomb right down through the
skylight of the good Bents&rsquo; and now all their
things are wrecked?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Bents&rsquo;!&rdquo; gasped Kent. &ldquo;Was any one
hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that we can&rsquo;t say. The young lady has
not been sleeping there lately but yesterday she
came and got the key and did not return it, so I
thought she must have slept there last night!
This morning we can find no trace of her. The
bomb did much damage, but surely it could not
have destroyed her completely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Destroyed her! What young lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mademoiselle Kean, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kent was glad of the strong arm of Jim Castleman.
He certainly needed a support but only for
a moment. He pushed through the crowd and
made his way to the shattered wall of the studio.
The bomb had not done so much damage as might
have been expected. The front wall was fallen
and the skylight was broken all over the floor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
The chairs and easels were piled up like jackstraws
at the beginning of a game. The bedrooms
were uninjured but the balcony where
Judy and Molly had slept that happy winter in
Paris had fallen.</p>

<p>Would Judy have slept up on the roost just
for auld lang syne or would she have occupied
a more comfortable bedroom? If she had been
blown into such small bits that there was nothing
to tell the tale, why should these other things
have escaped? There were the blue tea cups in
the china closet uninjured, although most of them
were turned over, showing that the shock had
reached them, too. What was that blue thing
lying on the divan in the corner under untold
débris?</p>

<p>Kent pulled off the timbers and broken glass
and unearthed Judy&rsquo;s blue serge dress, which was
waiting to be dyed a dismal black. He clasped
it in his arms in an agony of apprehension. Letters
fell out of the pocket. He recognized his
mother&rsquo;s handwriting, also Molly&rsquo;s. So, Judy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
had heard from Kentucky! He stuffed them back
in the jacket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim, I simply don&rsquo;t believe she was here. I
couldn&rsquo;t have slept all night like such a lummux
if she&mdash;if she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, old fellow! I know! I don&rsquo;t believe she
was here, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just know I would have had some premonition
of it! I would have been conscious of it if
anything had been happening to Judy,&rdquo; which
showed that Kent Brown was his mother&rsquo;s own
son. He was not going to mourn the loss of a
loved one until he was sure the loved one was
gone, and he had her own unfailing faith that
something could not have happened to one he
cared for without his being aware of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure you would!&rdquo; declared Jim, not at all sure
but relieved that his friend was taking that view
of the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know something that will be a positive proof
whether she was here or not last night.&rdquo; Kent
walked firmly to the bath room, which was behind
the bed rooms and out of the path of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
bomb. He threw open the door and looked
eagerly on the little glass shelf for a tooth brush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a sign of one. I know and you know that
if Judy had been here last night her tooth brush
would have been here, too. I am sure now!
Come on, and let&rsquo;s look somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kent went out with Judy&rsquo;s serge dress over
his arm. The concierge looked sadly after him:
&ldquo;Her dress is all he has to cherish now. The poor
young man! I used to see he was in love with
her when Mrs. Brune was in the Bents&rsquo; studio
and her son occupied the one to the right with
Mr. Kinsella. Oh, la la! <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais la vie est amer!&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>The crowd dispersed, since there was nothing
more to see and the hour for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner a la
fourchette</i> was approaching. The concierge went
off to visit her daughter who was ill. The studios
were all empty now and her duties were light.
Her husband was to see that no one entered the
court to carry off the Bents&rsquo; things, which were
exposed pitifully to the gaze of the public until
the authorities could do something. He, good
man, waited a little while and then made his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
to a neighbouring <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brasserie</i> to get his tumbler of
absinthe, and one tumbler led to another and
forgetfulness followed soon, and the Bents&rsquo; studio
properties were but dreams to his befuddled
brain.</p>

<p>Judy had spent a busy morning. Marie had
gone to carry tarts to &ldquo;the regiment&rdquo; and all of
the waiting in the shop fell on her. She did it
gladly, thankful that she was so busy she could
not think. She measured soup and weighed spinach
and potato salad and wrapped up tarts until
her back ached. Finally Mère Tricot came
in from the baking of more tarts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My child, go out for a while. You need the
air. I am here now to feed these gourmands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Mother! I want to get my dress
at the studio. Marie says she will dye it for
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly! Certainly! We can save many a
sou by doing it ourselves. Go, child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy put on her little mourning bonnet and
sadly found her way to the Rue Brea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder where the bomb hit last night. Père
Tricot said near the Luxembourg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What was her amazement to find the poor
studio in ruins. No concierge to tell her a thing
about it, for her lodge was locked tight and no
one near. Judy picked her way sadly over the
fallen front wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get my dress, anyhow.&rdquo; But although she
was sure it had been on the divan in the studio,
no dress was to be found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll have to have something to wear besides
this thin waist. I am cold now, and what
will I do when winter, real winter comes? I
shall have to send to Giverny for my trunk, and
no telling what it will cost to get it here. Oh,
oh, how am I to go on? I wish to God I had
been sleeping on that balcony when the bomb
struck. Then I would have been at peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy gave herself up to the despair that was
in her heart. She made a thorough search for
the suit through the poor wrecked apartment but
no sign of it could she see. She went sadly back
to the delicatessen shop and stepped behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
counter, her hat still on, to assist the good Mother
Tricot, who was being besieged with customers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take off your hat, child. Here is a fresh cap
of Marie&rsquo;s and an apron. Did you get your
dress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy told her kind friend of the bomb-wrecked
studio and her lost suit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the vandals! The wretches! There must
be a Prussian in our midst who would be so low
as to steal your suit. No Frenchman would have
done it. Before the war,&mdash;yes, but now there is
not one who would do such a dastardly trick.
We are all of one family now, high and low, rich
and poor,&mdash;and we do not prey on one another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it makes very little difference,&rdquo; said
Judy resignedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send for my trunk. I
have other suits in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Other suits! Oh, what riches!&rdquo; but then the
old woman considered that the friend of the
Marquise d&rsquo;Ochtè perhaps had many other suits.</p>

<p>Judy donned the cap and apron and went on
with the shop keeping. No one could have told
her from a poor little bereaved French girl. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
cap was becoming, as was also the organdy collar.
Her face was pale and her eyes full of unshed
tears, but the sorrow had given to Judy&rsquo;s
face something that her enemies might have said
it had lacked: a softness and depth of feeling.
Her friends knew that her heart was warm and
true and that the feeling was there, but her life
had been care free with no troubles except the
scrapes that she had been as clever getting out
of as she had been adroit getting in. She had
many times considered herself miserable before
but now she realized that all other troubles had
been nothing&mdash;this was something she had had
no conception of&mdash;this tightening of the heart
strings, this hopeless feeling of the bottom having
dropped out of the universe.</p>

<p>She felt absolutely friendless, except for her
dear Tricots. The Browns could never see her
again. They must blame her, as it was all her
fault that Kent had come for her. If she had
not been so full of her own conceit, she would
certainly have sailed for America when all the
others did at the breaking out of the war. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
mother and father seemed as remote as though
they were on another planet. The war might
last for years and there seemed no chance of
their leaving Berlin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just stay on here and earn my board and
keep,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;The Tricots find me useful
and they want me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meantime, Kent and Jim Castleman went
and sat down in the Garden of the Luxembourg
to smoke and talk it over, Kent still fondly clasping
the serge dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find her all right before night,&rdquo; declared
Kent. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be sure to go to the Bents&rsquo; studio
sometime to-day. I&rsquo;ll write a note and leave it
with the concierge. I&rsquo;ll also leave a note at the
American Club. She must go there twice a
week at least. I&rsquo;d like to know where the poor
little thing is,&rdquo; and Kent heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet she is all right, wherever she is,&rdquo; comforted
Jim. &ldquo;Say, Brown, I don&rsquo;t like to mention
it, but I am starved to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not mention it! Why not?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see when a pal is in trouble it seems
so low to go get hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not in trouble. Now if I thought
that Judy had been in that place last night there
would be something to be troubled about, but as
it is, I just can&rsquo;t find her for a few hours, or
maybe minutes. Where shall we eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s up to you. I&rsquo;m getting mighty low in
funds, so let&rsquo;s do it cheap but do it a plenty,&rdquo;
and Jim looked rather ruefully at his few remaining
francs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am still in funds but I shall have to go it
mighty easy, too, to get Judy and me home. I
tell you what we might do. Let&rsquo;s go to a shop
where they have ready cooked food and bring
it out here and eat it. They say you can live on
half what it costs to eat in a restaurant. When
I was studying over here I knew lots of fellows
who lived that way. Of course, they had studios
where they could take the stuff and eat it, but
the Luxembourg Garden is good enough. I
know a place where the Perkinses used to deal.
They are the funny lot I told you about, the long-haired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
man and the short-haired woman. He
is driving an ambulance now and goodness knows
where she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go to it. I am so hungry I can
hardly waddle. These Continental breakfasts
with nothing but bread and coffee don&rsquo;t fill me up
half way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kent smiled, remembering the two full orders
and the four eggs his friend had tucked away, but
he said nothing. Having a good appetite of his
own, he had naught but sympathy for his famished
friend.</p>

<p>They left the garden and made for the shop
where Jo and Polly Perkins had bought their
ready cooked provisions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These people make some little pies that are
mighty good, too. We might get half a dozen or
so of them as a top off,&rdquo; suggested Kent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine! I&rsquo;ve got a mouth for pie, all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy had gone to the kitchen for a moment
to bring to the fore the smoked tongue that Père
Tricot had been slicing in those paper-thin slices
that he alone knew how to accomplish. She bore
aloft a great platter of the viand, the even slices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
arranged like a wreath of autumn leaves. While
she was still in the living room behind the shop,
two strangers entered. Their backs being to
the light, Judy only saw their silhouettes as they
bent over the show cases eagerly discussing what
selection of meats and vegetables they should
make, while Mère Tricot, accustomed to slim-pocketed
customers, patiently waited. Suddenly
she leaned over the counter and touched something
which one of the young men had thrown
over his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; she demanded with the manner
she could so well assume, that of a woman of
the Commune who meant to right her wrongs.</p>

<p>The purchaser of sauce and potato salad, the
two cheapest and most filling of the wares, held
up rather sheepishly a blue serge suit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle! Mademoiselle! Come quick!
It is your suit&mdash;and no Frenchman, as I said, but
a Prussian, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grenadier slid quickly from behind the
counter and putting her brawny arm out, held
the door firmly, so that no escape could be possible.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<small>WASTED DYE.</small></h2>


<p>Judy emerged from behind the curtains which
divided the family living room from the little
shop, the platter of tongue held high. In her
cap and apron, she reminded one of a Howard
Pyle illustration for some holiday number of a
magazine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, what a beaut!&rdquo; exclaimed the taller of
the two strangers.</p>

<p>The one with the serge suit dropped it and
made a rush for the girl. He had her in his arms,
platter of tongue and all, before Mère Tricot
could rescue it. But that dame managed to extricate
the big dish before any greater damage
was done than disarranging the effect of a wreath
of autumn leaves.</p>

<p>Hearts that were broken may be mended but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
platters of smoked tongue must not be dropped
on the floor and smashed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Judy gal, Judy gal! Tell me all about
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kent! Kent! I thought you were drowned
and have gone into mourning for you,&rdquo; sobbed
Judy.</p>

<p>As for Jim Castleman, in the most execrable
and impossible French, he was explaining to good
Mother Tricot how it all happened, and Father
Tricot hastened to the shop from his carving to
find out what it was all about, and then such a
handshaking and hugging as ensued was never
seen!</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were all about to sit down to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner a la
fourchette</i>,&rdquo; said the ever hospitable old man,
&ldquo;and if the young gentlemen would come with
us, we should be much honoured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grenadier was equally pleased to have them
and, indeed, Jim Castleman was so hungry by
that time that he would have eaten cold spinach
with his fingers.</p>

<p>How that old couple plied the young Americans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
with their delightful food and how they
listened to their tale of shipwreck and rescue!
When Kent told of their fooling the Prussians
with Tutno, the childish language they had known
in their youth, the Tricots laughed with such glee
that a gendarme put his head in the door to
see what it was all about. When Jim Castleman
in a speech that sounded more like Tutno than
Parisian French, informed his hosts that he was
there to join the army of Joffre, old Mère Tricot
helped him to two more tarts, although he had
already eaten enough of them to furnish dessert
for any ordinary French family of four.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Madame,&rdquo; said Kent to his hostess,
&ldquo;I want you to do another thing for me. You
have done so many things already that maybe
I should not ask you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, mon brave?&rdquo; and the old woman
smiled very kindly on the young American, whom
she had not half an hour before called a Prussian
and accused of stealing Judy&rsquo;s serge suit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am to be married very soon and I want you
to help me out in it.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Married!&rdquo; Judy gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Judy Kean, I am to be married and
so are you. What&rsquo;s more, it is to be just as soon
as the French law will tie the knot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of all the slippery parties, I know you
are the slipperiest and I have no idea of letting
you get away. Am I right, Jim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim was too busy with a tart to be coherent.
He nodded his head, however, and when Kent
put the same question to Mère Tricot in French,
she upheld him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be much more convenable if you
were married. It is very easy to get married
in war time. The authorities are not near so
difficult to approach on the subject. I will see
what can be done by the magistrate who married
Jean and Marie, and no doubt if you interview
your American Ambassador, much can be attended
to in a short time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kent Brown, if you think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; sputtered
Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think a thing, I just know,&rdquo; said Kent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
very calmly. &ldquo;Put on your hat, honey, and let&rsquo;s
take a little walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all right&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Was this the Judy
Kean who prided herself on so well knowing her
own mind, calmly consenting to be married
against her will? Was it against her will? She
suddenly remembered the communings she had
had with herself, in which she had cried out to
Kent: &ldquo;Why, why, did you not make me go with
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall have to rip the lining out of my hat
before I can go out,&rdquo; she said quite meekly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lining out of your hat?&rdquo; questioned
Kent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you see I went into mourning when&mdash;when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
and Judy, now that it was all over,
still could not voice the terrible thing she thought
had happened to Kent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t rip it out until I see you in it.
Not many men live to see how their widows look
mourning for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Widows, indeed! Kent Brown, you presume
too much!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy, but she could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
help laughing. The hat was very becoming and
she was not loathe to wear it, just once.</p>

<p>First Mère Tricot must be assisted with the
dishes, however; but then Judy got ready to go
walking with Kent.</p>

<p>Père Tricot undertook to be guide to Jim Castleman,
offering to lead him to the proper place
to enlist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll only look into it to-day,&rdquo; said Jim, grasping
Kent&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t join for keeps until
I have officiated as best man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy, who had gone into Marie&rsquo;s tiny bedroom
to get into her rescued serge suit, overheard
this remark and blushed to the roots of her fluffy
hair. As she put on her white lined hat, she
peeped again into the mirror: &ldquo;Judy Kean, you
are much too rosy for a widow,&rdquo; she admonished
her image.</p>

<p>Mère Tricot saw them off, her good man and
Jim to the recruiting station, and Kent and Judy
to the Luxembourg Gardens, a spot hallowed by
lovers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;The good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
God has brought the poor lamb her lover from
the grave. I am glad, very glad,&mdash;but it is certainly
a pity to waste all that good dye the butcher&rsquo;s
wife saved for us. It is not good when kept
too long, either. I won&rsquo;t throw it out yet a while,
though,&mdash;some one will be wanting it, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<small>A WAR BRIDE.</small></h2>


<p>Marrying in Paris was certainly a much easier
matter than it had been almost two years before
when Molly Brown and Edwin Green had struggled
to have the nuptial knot tied. Judy&rsquo;s baptismal
certificate was not demanded as had been
Molly&rsquo;s, and the long waiting for research work,
as Kent expressed it, was not required. Mère
Tricot undertook to engineer the affair and did
it with such expedition that it could have been
accomplished even before Judy got her trunk
from Giverny.</p>

<p>It was very nice to have one&rsquo;s trunk again, although
it really was embarrassing to take up so
much of the Tricots&rsquo; living room with the huge
American affair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems funny to be married without any
trousseau,&rdquo; Judy confided to Mère Tricot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No trousseau! And what is in that great
box if not trousseau?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know. I really haven&rsquo;t
any clothes to speak of that I can remember,&rdquo; declared
Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let us see them!&rdquo; begged Marie and
her belle mère.</p>

<p>They were dying of curiosity to peep into the
great box, so Judy unpacked for their benefit,
and their eyes opened wide at her stack of shirt
waists and lingerie and her many shoes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two more suits and a great coat, silk dresses&mdash;at
least three of them&mdash;and skirts and shirts
of duck and linen!&rdquo; exclaimed Marie. &ldquo;And
hats and gloves&mdash;and blouses enough for three!
Not many war brides will boast such a trousseau.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So our bride began to feel that in comparison
to the little Marie, she had so much that she
must not worry about wedding clothes. Instead,
she divided her store of riches, and making up
a bundle with a silk dress and some blouses and
lingerie, a suit and a hat, she hid it in Mère<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Tricot&rsquo;s linen press for Marie to find when she,
Judy, was married and gone over the seas.</p>

<p>She well knew that the French girl would not
accept the present unless it were given to her in
a very tactful way, and just to find it in the linen
press with her name on it and the donor out of
reach seemed to Judy the most diplomatic method.</p>

<p>Madame le Marquise d&rsquo;Ochtè must be looked
up again. Not only were Kent and Judy very
fond of her, but they knew they could not show
their faces to Mrs. Brown unless they had seen
her dear Sally Bolling. This time they found
her in the old home in the Faubourg. She had
been to the front and come back to get her house
in readiness for the wounded.</p>

<p>Could this be the gay and volatile Marquise,
this sad looking, middle-aged woman? She had
grown almost thin during those few months of
the war. Her beautiful Titian hair was now
streaked with grey. Judy remembered with a
choking feeling the first time she had come to
the Ochtè home on that night soon after Molly
and her mother had arrived in Paris, when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
had dined in the Faubourg and then gone to
hear <cite>Louise</cite> at the Opera. The Marquise had
been radiant in black velvet and diamonds, a
beautiful, gay woman that one could hardly believe
to be the mother of Philippe. She had
looked so young, so sparkling. She had said at
one time that she allowed no grey hairs to stay
in her head, but had her maid pull them out no
matter how it hurt. Now it would take all a
maid&rsquo;s time to keep down the grey hairs in that
head, and would leave but a scant supply for a
coiffure could they be extracted.</p>

<p>Kent thought she looked more like his mother
and loved her for it. Her greeting was very
warm and her interest great in what Judy and
Kent had been doing and what they meant to do.
She received them in the great salon that had
been converted into a hospital ward. All of
the Louis Quinze furniture had been stored away
in an upper chamber and now in its place were
long rows of cots. The floor was bare of the
handsome rugs which had been the delight and
envy of Judy on former visits, and now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
parquetted boards were frotted to a point of
cleanliness that no germ would have dared to
violate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left the pictures for the poor fellows to look
at&mdash;that is, those who are spared their eyesight,&rdquo;
she said sadly. &ldquo;My hospital opens to-morrow,
but I want the privilege of giving a wedding
breakfast to you young people. I can well manage
it in the small <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle à manger</i>. That is left as
it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are so kind, but dear old Mère Tricot
is making a great cake for us and she would be
sad indeed if she could not give the breakfast,&rdquo;
explained Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is as it should be,&rdquo; said the Marquise
kindly, &ldquo;but am I invited?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Invited! Of course you are invited, and the
Marquis and Philippe if they can be got hold
of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are still in camp and have not gone to
the fore, so I will manage to reach them. Jean
is very busy, drilling all the time, but a family
wedding must be attended. Philippe is learning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
to fly,&rdquo; and she closed her eyes a moment as
though to shut out the remembrance of accidents
that happen all the time to the daring aviators.</p>

<p>Judy wondered if he had come in contact with
Josephine Perkins, but said nothing as it was
a deep secret that Jo was passing off as a man
and a word might give her away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are many Americans in the aviation
camp, and very clever and apt they are, Philippe
says. I am proud of my countrymen for coming
forward as they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think it is great for them to. I&mdash;I&mdash;think
I ought not to marry Kent and go off and
leave so much work to be done. I ought to help.
Don&rsquo;t you think so, Cousin Sally?&rdquo; asked
Judy.</p>

<p>The Marquise smiled at Judy&rsquo;s calling her
cousin, smiled and liked it. Kent looked uneasy
and a little sullen. Suppose his Judy should balk
at the last minute and refuse to leave the stirring
scenes of war! What then? He had sworn not
to return to United States without her, and unless
he did return in a very short time, the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
good job he had picked up in New York would
be filled by some more fortunate and less in love
young architect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear, it is not the duty of all American
girls to stay on this side and nurse any
more than it is the duty of all American men
to stay here and fight. Only those must do it who
are called, as it were, by the spirit. You must
marry my young cousin and go back to United
States, and there your duty will begin, not only
to make him the brave, fine wife that I know it
is in you to make, but also to remember suffering
France and Belgium. There is much work
waiting for you. This war will last for years,
thanks to that same Belgium who threw herself
in the breach and stopped the tide of Prussians
flowing into France. If it had not been for Belgium,
the war would have been over now&mdash;yes,
over&mdash;but France would have been under the
heel of the tyrant and Belgium off of the map.
Thank God for that brave little country!&rdquo; and
Judy and Kent bowed their heads as at a benediction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Kent kissed the Marquise for her sensible advice.
He very well knew that Judy would have
been a great acquisition to his cousin&rsquo;s hospital,
and that workers were not numerous (not so
plentiful at the beginning of the war as they
were later). Her advice was certainly unselfish.
He thanked her, also, for realizing that it was
not up to all American men to stay and fight.
He had no desire to fight any one unless his own
country was at war, and then he felt he would
do his duty as his ancestors had done before
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you what we&rsquo;ll do, you children and I:
I&rsquo;ll order out the car&mdash;I still keep one and a chauffeur
so that with it I can bring the wounded back
to Paris&mdash;and we will go out to the aviation camp
and see Philippe and ask him to the wedding.
You would like to see the camp, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Above all things!&rdquo; exclaimed Kent and Judy
in chorus.</p>

<p>The broad grassy field, bordered by houses,
sheds and workshops, presented a busy scene as
the Ochtè car drove up. Biplanes were parked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
to one side like so many automobiles at a reception
in a city, or buggies at a county seat on
court day in an American town. The field was
swarming with men, all eagerly watching a tiny
speck off in the blue sky in the direction of the
trenches where the French had called a halt on
the Germans&rsquo; insolent and triumphant march to
Paris.</p>

<p>No more attempt was made to stop the car of
Madame the Marquise from coming into the aviation
camp than there would have been had she
been Joffre himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They know me very well,&rdquo; she said in answer
to Kent&rsquo;s inquiry as to this phenomenon, as he
well knew they were very strict about visitors in
camp. &ldquo;I am ever a welcome guest here, not
only because they know I love them, but because
of something I bring.&rdquo; She pointed to a great
hamper of goodies packed in by the chauffeur.</p>

<p>The car was surrounded by eager and courteous
young aviators and soldiers, and Kent and
Judy well knew it was not all for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gateaux</i>
that the Marquise was so beloved. Philippe was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
summoned and clasped in his mother&rsquo;s arms.
Her heart cried out that every time might be the
last.</p>

<p>The Marquise was changed but her son even
more so. His dilettantish manner was gone for
good, as was also his foppish beard. His face,
clean shaven except for a small moustache, was
brown and lean; his mouth had taken on purpose;
his eyes were no longer merely beautiful
but now had depth of expression and a look of
pity, as though he had seen much sorrow.</p>

<p>He was greatly pleased to see his cousin Kent
and also Miss Kean, who, of course, he thought
had gone back to America long ago. He remembered
Judy always as the young lady he came
so near loving. Indeed, he would have addressed
her when Molly Brown had refused him, had
he not been made to understand by his fair cousin
how important it was to love with one&rsquo;s whole
soul if married happiness was to be expected.
He had, after that, gone very slowly in possible
courtships. Molly&rsquo;s friend, Frances Andrews,
had almost been his choice, but there was something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of fineness lacking in her that deterred him
in time, and he was in a measure relieved when
that dashing young woman proceeded to marry
an impoverished Italian prince. His mother was
relieved beyond measure at what she could not
but look on as her Philippe&rsquo;s escape. In fact,
she had never seen but one girl she thought would
be just right for her beloved son and that was
Molly Brown.</p>

<p>Philippe was told of Kent&rsquo;s being shipwrecked
and of Judy&rsquo;s having taken up her abode with the
Tricots. This last bit of information amused
him greatly. Judy told with much sprightliness
of her serving in the shop and of her learning
to make tarts. Philippe began to look upon his
cousin Kent as a very lucky dog. He sighed when
he promised to come to the wedding breakfast,
that is, if he could get leave. Why did all of
the charming American girls pass him by?</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J&rsquo;ai la France et ma mère</i>,&rdquo; he muttered, as
his arm crept around the waist of that beloved
mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What are they all looking at so intently?&rdquo;
asked Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that is a daring young American aviator
who has gone to seek some information concerning
the trenches of our friends the enemy.
He is a strange, quiet little fellow. No one ever
gets a word out of him but he has learned to manage
his machine quicker than any of the
nouveaux, and now is intrusted to carry out all
kinds of dangerous orders. He looks like a boy
sometimes and sometimes when he is tired, like
a strange little old man. He is not very friendly
but is quick at repartee and so the fellows let
him alone. Speaks French like a Parisian. I
have seen him before somewhere, but can&rsquo;t place
him. I asked him once and he was quite stiff
and said I had the advantage of him. Of course
I didn&rsquo;t like to force myself on him after that,
but I&rsquo;d really like to be friendly if he would let
me. See, here he comes! Look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They watched in silence the aeroplane sinking
in a lovely spiral glide. As it sank to rest on
the greensward, many hands were outstretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
to assist the grotesque little figure to alight. Judy
recognized in an instant the person she had
thought all the time Philippe was describing. It
was, of course, Jo Bill Perkins. She was swathed
in a dark leather coat and breeches, with a strange
shaped cap coming down over her ears. The
great goggles she wore could not deceive
Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo; she asked Philippe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Williams is all I know, J. Williams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I know him. Would you mind taking
him my card and asking him to come speak to
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit, but I don&rsquo;t believe he will come.
Let him make his report first, and then I will tell
him you are here. You are very charming and
fetching, Mademoiselle, but I doubt your being
able to bring Williams to your feet.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>THE FLIGHT.</small></h2>


<p>Judy felt that perhaps she was not quite fair
to Jo to test her by this interview, but she did long
to speak to her. If Kent and Cousin Sally recognized
her, she knew full well she could trust them
to keep silent.</p>

<p>Philippe crossed the field and stopped the daring
little aviator just after he had made his
report to the commander.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A young lady is asking for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A young lady for me? Absurd!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she has heard of your wonderful feats
and longs to meet you,&rdquo; teased Philippe; and then
added: &ldquo;Really, Williams, you are superb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all! Well, I am tired and don&rsquo;t want
to meet any young ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this one already knows you,&rdquo; and Philippe
produced Judy&rsquo;s card.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Julia Kean,&rdquo; Jo read in amazement.
&ldquo;How did she get out here, anyhow? Where
is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over here with my mother,&rdquo; and Philippe
looked with some amusement at the evident blush
that spread over Jo&rsquo;s freckled cheeks. She still
had on the grotesque cap and goggles which would
have made recognition of her difficult. She
wanted very much to see Judy. She wanted to
hear something of her Polly, too, and she intended
to have Judy look him up if possible, and report
to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you see her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Kean is a charming girl, Williams, isn&rsquo;t
she?&rdquo; said the quizzing Philippe, looking searchingly
at his companion as they made their way
across the field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; said Jo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you known her long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite a while,&rdquo; and Jo&rsquo;s cheeks again were
suffused with a dark flush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little fellow!&rdquo; thought Philippe. &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
can&rsquo;t bear to tell him she is to be married. He is
such a dare devil the chances are he will be killed
before long and he may never have to know that
his inamorata has chosen a better looking man,
not a better man&mdash;they don&rsquo;t make them to beat
little Williams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they approached the car, impulsive Judy
jumped out and ran to meet her friend. Jo ran,
too, and they embraced with such ardor that
Philippe stood back amazed. Maybe Kent Brown
was not to be so envied, after all. If the girl who
was to marry him in a day was so lavish with
her embraces for other men, what kind of wife
would she make? Of course, Williams was a
rather dried up person, but then a man&rsquo;s a man
for a&rsquo; that.</p>

<p>Kent, too, was rather astonished when his
fiancée left him with such precipitation and before
all the aviation camp hugged and kissed the
strange bunchy little figure. Ardor for the heroes
of France was all well enough, but a fellow&rsquo;s
sweetheart need not be quite so warm in her
manner of showing her appreciation, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
when the fellow happens not to be one himself
in the habit of making daily daring flights to spy
out the weakness in the trenches of the enemy.</p>

<p>The Marquise laughed as she had not done
since the first week in August of that terrible
year. Kent looked at her in astonishment. She
was not so very much like his mother, after all.
His mother would not have been so much amused
over the discomfiture of a young lover.</p>

<p>That matron was saying to herself: &ldquo;How
stupid men are!&rdquo; She had recognized Jo from
the beginning. Kent had known in some far
off corner of his brain that Mrs. Polly Perkins
was doing something or other about the war,
but his mind had been so taken up with his own
affairs and Judy&rsquo;s possible danger that that
knowledge had stayed in the corner of his brain
while the more important matter of getting married
was uppermost. Suddenly the truth flashed
over him and he was overcome with laughter,
too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caught on, eh?&rdquo; asked his cousin.</p>

<p>He nodded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We must keep mum,&rdquo; she admonished.
&ldquo;There is no reason why a woman should not do
her part this way if she can. I&rsquo;d fly in a minute
if that would help any. Of course these stupid
men would raise a hue and cry if they knew a
woman was carrying off the honours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am as quiet as the grave,&rdquo; declared Kent.</p>

<p>Judy came to the car with her friend and with
the utmost audacity introduced Jo as Mr. Williams.
The Marquise greeted the supposed young
man graciously. Kent sprang out and shook
Jo warmly by the hand, much to the astonishment
of his cousin Philippe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I see you a moment alone?&rdquo; whispered
Jo in Judy&rsquo;s ear. The Marquise, as though she
divined what was in the heart of Mrs. Polly
Perkins, asked her to come sit in the car; and
then she suggested that Philippe show the camp
to Kent and on second thought decided to go with
them. The chauffeur had been sent with the
hamper to the mess hall, so Judy and Jo had a
few minutes alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must find out something about Polly. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
feel as though I could wait no longer for news
of him. Can&rsquo;t you help me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know I am to be married to-morrow
and sail for United States, but I am going to
see that news is got to you somehow. Cousin
Sally will do it, of course. She is the very
person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but that Philippe must not know. He
has already been very curious about where he
has seen me before, and I have had to be insufferably
rude to him to keep him from prying into
my past. I have made good as a man, but still
they would not like it, I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How on earth did you ever get in? I am dying
to hear all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, naturally the examination for physical
fitness was worrying me some. I got that little
dried up art student named Joel Williams, the
one who was always trying to claim kin with me,
to take the examination and then let me slip in
in his place. I bought his ticket to America to
pay him for his trouble. He was broke, as usual,
and scared to death when the war started, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
willing to do anything to get home. It was really
very simple to manage it. I am the same type,
in a way, although I hope I am not so dried up
as my would-be cousin. Same initials, too, which
made the entering rather more regular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jo, what a girl you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shh! Don&rsquo;t call me a girl even to yourself.
Do you think the Marquise d&rsquo;Ochtè recognized
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she did and Kent, too! Do you
think they would have left us alone if they had
not thought you were safe? Kent wouldn&rsquo;t have
left me with such a bird if he had not known who
the bird was. He would be afraid I might fly
away with you. Oh, Jo, I do so want to fly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, could I really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so. I have brought in information
to our commander that is valuable enough for
me to ask one small favor of him. Come on, let&rsquo;s
ask!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls were across the field and knocking
for admittance at the Commander&rsquo;s tent before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the Marquise and the two young men had
begun their tour of inspection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A favor to ask!&rdquo; exclaimed the grizzled old
warrior who sat poring over a map where Jo
had only a few moments before added some
crosses that meant much to the tactics of the
French army.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to take a friend up in a machine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A friend! I am sorry, my son, but it is hard
to tell friends in this day of war. I can&rsquo;t let
you. He might be no friend, after all, to France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He! It is not a man but an American girl.
She is just outside your tent,&rdquo; and Jo raised the
flap and motioned Judy to enter. Judy was introduced.
The old warrior looked at her searchingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, are you related to Robert Kean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His daughter, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert Kean&rsquo;s daughter! Why, my child,
your father and I have been close friends for
years. Tell me where he is and what he is doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Judy told of her father&rsquo;s letter and his being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
held in Berlin because of the knowledge he
had of Turkey&rsquo;s topography. She made him
laugh long and loud when she told of the ridiculous
limericks he had written on the paper
boats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Robert Kean&rsquo;s daughter, want to
fly, and to fly with our bravest and most daring
aviator! Well, don&rsquo;t fly off to America with him,&mdash;and
God bless you, my children,&rdquo; and he gave
Judy a fatherly embrace and went back to his
map.</p>

<p>When Kent got back to the car with his cousin,
there was no Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where can she have gone and where is Williams?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philippe looked rather mysterious. Young
girls who rushed up and embraced bird men with
such ardor should not be allowed too much
rope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt she will be back soon. Williams
is perhaps showing her the camp. Look, there
goes another machine up! Two in it! By Jove,
it is Williams! I can tell by his way of starting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
He has such a smooth getaway always. Could
the passenger be Miss Kean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than likely,&rdquo; said Kent composedly.
&ldquo;She has always been crazy to fly. I reckon
Williams will take good care of her and not go
too high or try any stunts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly not!&rdquo; said Philippe wonderingly.
Americans were a riddle to him. He
never quite understood his own mother, who had
rather a casual idea of proprieties herself at
times. That good lady, coming up just then,
expressed no concern over the impropriety of
Judy&rsquo;s flying with a man when she was to be
married on the morrow to some one else.</p>

<p>Kent sat in the car with his cousin Sally and
together they enjoyed Judy&rsquo;s flight. Jo took her
as close to the fighting line as she dared, but she
had no idea of endangering the life of her passenger.
They dipped and curved, for the most
part confining their maneuvers to the vicinity
of the camp. Judy never spoke one word, but
held her breath and wept for sheer joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be flying! To be flying! Oh, Judy Kean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
you lucky dog!&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;All my life
I&rsquo;ve been dreaming I could fly and now I am
doing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dizzy?&rdquo; asked Jo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but happy enough to die,&rdquo; gasped Judy.
&ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t going to be married, I&rsquo;d be a bird
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the landing was finally made and Judy
stepped out, the world seemed very stale, flat and
unprofitable. She was glad Kent was there waiting
for her. If she could not be a bird man,
she could at least be a very happy war bride.
The great leather coat she had worn in her
flight was very ugly and unbecoming, and she
was thankful for one thing that she did not have
to wear such frightful looking clothes all the
time.</p>

<p>On the way back to Paris she asked cousin
Sally how she had recognized Jo Williams so
readily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By her feet, of course! Why, no man on
earth ever had such eternally feminine feet.&rdquo;
That good lady promised to find out immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
something about Polly and let his spunky wife
know where and how he was. &ldquo;She will have
the Cross of Honour before she gets through,
Philippe says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t feel as though it were your duty
to tell she is a woman, do you?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Duty to tell! Heavens, child! I feel it is
my duty to help France in every way I can, and
surely to get that girl out of the aviation corps
would be a hindrance to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la Patrie</i>. I doubt even
Philippe&rsquo;s thinking it his duty to tell, and,&rdquo; with
a twinkle in her eye that the horrors of war could
not altogether dim, &ldquo;Philippe has a very stern
idea of his duty. He felt maybe it was his duty
to get in a flying machine and go after you and
Mr. Williams so he could chaperone you. He
felt that the dignity of the family was at stake,&mdash;so
soon to be the bride of his cousin and flying
with another man! Terrible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course! I never thought of how it
looked. There I went and hugged and kissed
Jo right before everybody. I bet you a sou this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
minute Philippe and all the rest of them are feeling
sorry for you, Kent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they needn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; declared that young
man as he found Judy&rsquo;s hand under the robe.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied&mdash;but I did feel a little funny for
half a minute when you went and kissed Jo so
warmly. It took me a moment longer to recognize
her. Why didn&rsquo;t you put me on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put you on? How could I, with all the people
around?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You promised me once you wouldn&rsquo;t fly with
anybody until you could fly with me. Don&rsquo;t you
remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I did, you goose! But I didn&rsquo;t say
anybody&mdash;I said any man; so you see I didn&rsquo;t
break my promise when I flew with Mrs. Polly
Perkins!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<small>THE WEDDING BREAKFAST.</small></h2>


<p>When the Marquise d&rsquo;Ochtè said she would
do something, she always did it and did it as well
as it could be done. When she undertook to find
out where and how Polly Perkins was for the
benefit of his spunky wife, she did it and did it
immediately. And not only did she find him,
but she got a little respite from duty for him and
bore him back to Paris where she had already
spirited Jo to be present at the wedding breakfast.
She had asked a holiday for Jo, too, although
the grizzled commander was loathe to
let his best aviator off even for a day.</p>

<p>Jo was taken to the converted d&rsquo;Ochtè mansion
and there dressed like a nice, feminine little
woman, her hair curled by madame&rsquo;s maid. A
tight velvet toque and a dotted veil completed
the transformation and the commander himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
would not have recognized his one time prize
aviator. All of this masquerade was for the sole
purpose of fooling Philippe, who, also, was to
be one of the guests at the Tricots&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Polly was so happy to see his Jo again that it
was pathetic to behold, and her pride in him and
his bravery was beautiful. Polly was vastly improved.
Kent, who had always liked the little
man and had insisted that there was much more
to him than the other members of the colony
could see, was delighted to have his opinion of
his friend verified.</p>

<p>The ceremony was a very simple one, performed,
not by the magistrate as Mère Tricot
had suggested, but at the Protestant Episcopal
Church. Polly Perkins gave away the bride, and
Jo looked as though she would burst with pride
at this honour done her husband. Jim Castleman
was best man, and Cousin Sally fell in love
with him on the spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is like the young men of my youth,&rdquo; she
declared, &ldquo;the young men of Kentucky, I am not
saying how many years ago.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>The little living room at the Tricots&rsquo; soon after
the ceremony was full to overflowing, but every
one squeezed in somehow. The old couple were
very happy in dispensing hospitality. Their Jean
came home for a few hours and their hearts were
thankful for this glimpse of their son. Marie
beamed with joy and the rosy baby delighted them
all by saying, &ldquo;Pa-pa!&rdquo; the first word it had ever
uttered.</p>

<p>Philippe, looking so handsome that Judy, too,
wondered that all the American girls passed him
by, fraternized with Jean, the peasant&rsquo;s son, with
that simplicity which characterizes the military
of France.</p>

<p>The party was very gay, so gay that it seemed
impossible that the Germans were really not more
than thirty miles from them. Of course they
talked politics, men and women. Old Mère Tricot
had her opinions and expressed them, and
they listened with respect when she pooh-poohed
and bah-bahed the notion that the Nations had
gone to war from altruistic motives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Belgium might as well die fighting as die not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
fighting. The Germans had her any way she
jumped. France had to fight, too, fight or be
enslaved. As for Great Britain&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t
well stay out of it! When the Germans got
Antwerp, why, where was England? Let us
fight, I say&mdash;fight to a finish; but let&rsquo;s be honest
about it and each country say she is fighting for
herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think United States should come over
and help?&rdquo; asked Kent, much interested in the
old woman&rsquo;s wisdom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless she has wrongs of her own to
right!&rdquo; spoke the grenadier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But think how France helped us out in &rsquo;76!&rdquo;
exclaimed Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and helped herself, no doubt. I am
not very educated in history, but I&rsquo;ll be bound
she had a crow of her own to pick with England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; laughed Philippe, &ldquo;France did
want to destroy the naval supremacy of Great
Britain. Her alliance with Spain meant more
to France than her alliance with America. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
was not wholly disinterested when she helped the
struggling states.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Heavens, Philippe, please don&rsquo;t take from
me the romantic passion I have always had for
Lafayette!&rdquo; begged his mother. &ldquo;I used to thrill
with joy when tales were told of my great grandmother&rsquo;s
dancing with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your passion for Lafayette. He was at
least brave and disinterested, but don&rsquo;t waste
much feeling on the government that backed him.
Vergennes, the minister of France at that time,
prepared a map in which the United States figured
as the same old colonial strip between the
Alleghenies and the sea. They had no idea of
helping United States to become a great nation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember reading a letter from Jay
in which he said: &lsquo;This court is interested in
separating us from Great Britain, but it is not
their interest that we should become a great and
formidable people.&rsquo; But I feel deeply grateful
to France for all she did,&rdquo; said Kent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, too!&rdquo; cried Jim Castleman. &ldquo;And I mean
to do all I can to pay it back.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! My American Lafayette!&rdquo; cried the
Marquise. &ldquo;A toast, a toast, to my American
Lafayette!&rdquo; And they stood up and drank a
toast to the blushing young giant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t dream any one could have such a good
time at her own wedding,&rdquo; said Judy when the
last vestige of cake had disappeared. It was a
wonderful cake with a tiny white sugar bride and
a chocolate groom perched on top. There had
been much holding of hands under the table.
Every other person seemed to be eating with his
or her left hand, and Cousin Sally complained
that she had no hand to eat with at all, as Philippe
held one of her hands and the American Lafayette
held the other.</p>

<p>The Marquis could not come, much to the regret
of all the company, for his regiment expected
to be called to the front any day and no
leaves could be granted.</p>

<p>Judy put up a brave front when adieux were
in order, but her heart was very sad. How
many terrible things might happen to these kind
friends she was leaving! The Tricots, good souls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
might be bereft at any moment. Dear Cousin
Sally, with two in the war, might be doubly
visited by the hand of death. Polly and Jo Perkins
were to part after this brief time of happiness,
holding hands under the Tricots&rsquo; hospitable
board, one to return to his office of caring for
the wounded, the other to her office of keeping
the German ambulance drivers busy. The young
Kentucky giant, Jim Castleman, was to join his
regiment on the following day. His glee at having
a chance to swat the Prussians was intense.
He didn&rsquo;t look like a person who could ever die,
but one bit of shrapnel might in the twinkling of
an eye destroy that virile youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come to see me when you can, my American
Lafayette,&rdquo; begged the Marquise, &ldquo;and if you get
so much as a tiny little wound, let me nurse you
if you can get to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim had delighted the little party by translating
into his execrable French football terms to
describe his idea of how the war should be conducted.
His left tackle was frankly: &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gauche
palan</i>,&rdquo; and his centre rush was: &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cintre jonc</i>.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>He and Kent were not very demonstrative in
their parting, but both of them felt it deeply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wuv e lul lul! Sus o lul o nun gug!&rdquo; called
Jim, as the cab bearing the bride and groom
started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gug o o dud lul u sank kuk!&rdquo; was Kent&rsquo;s feeling
rejoinder.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<small>THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.</small></h2>


<p>No submarine warfare interrupted the peaceful
passage of our honeymooners. The voyage was
delightful to both of them after all the trials they
had been through. Judy was as much at home
on the water as on land, literally a born sailor, as
she had been born at sea. Kent loved a ship and
all the many aspects of the ocean. The lazy days
on deck, with their chairs drawn as close together
as chairs could be, their hands clasped
under the steamer rug, seemed like a beautiful
dream, only a dream that was going to last for
a lifetime, not the lazy days on deck but the
being together and never talking out. Being
lazy was not the idea of eternal bliss common to
either of these young persons. Kent felt there
were worlds to conquer in the architectural universe
and he meant to do his share towards conquering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
them; and with Judy by his side, he
gloried in the task before him. As for Judy,
she meant to paint like mad and to work up many
ideas she had teeming in her head. She was
thankful for the reels of undeveloped snapshots
she had in her trunk, as she was going to use
them as a jog to her memory for the numerous
illustrations she meant to make in an article she
was thinking of writing on Paris at the outbreak
of the war.</p>

<p>Cousin Sally&rsquo;s admonition to work for the Allies
was not forgotten, either. Judy was planning
a busy winter for herself in New York just
as soon as she and Kent could get themselves settled
in an apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be very inexpensive, too, Kent. We
must save money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kent couldn&rsquo;t help laughing at Judy&rsquo;s solemn
face. What would Judy&rsquo;s friends say at her becoming
penurious? Judy, the spendthrift!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;ve always cost poor Bobby a lot
of money; not that he has ever complained, but
I don&rsquo;t mean to be a burden to you, Kent.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>Kent had no answer for such foolishness but
to squeeze her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be perfectly happy if I just knew that
Bobby and poor little Mumsy were all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, they may be on the high seas this minute.
We will surely hear something of them when
we get to New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sandy Hook was at last sighted and then came
the slow, majestic steaming into the harbour!
Liberty still held her torch on high with the gulls
circling around her. The same little tugs were
puffing up and down, with the great ferries plying
back and forth like huge shuttles. New
York&rsquo;s sky line was as fascinating to Mrs. Kent
Brown as it had ever been to Judy Kean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Kent, I love it so! How could I have
stayed away so long?&rdquo; cried Judy, rapturously
making sketches in the air.</p>

<p>The pier was filled with an eager crowd, awaiting
the arrival of the steamer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any one for us,&rdquo; said Judy
rather wistfully. &ldquo;Your mother is in Kentucky,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
and of course Molly couldn&rsquo;t leave the baby to
come meet us, and there isn&rsquo;t any one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kent smiled and said nothing. He was almost
sure he saw the figure of his tall brother-in-law,
Professor Green, towering above the crowd, but
he was afraid he might be mistaken and could
not bear to disappoint Judy.</p>

<p>It was Edwin Green and hanging on one arm
was Molly (Kent knew her by the blue scarf).
And who was that on the other arm? Oh, what
a mother! It was Mrs. Brown, her face uplifted
and glowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judy, look a little to the left of the second
post! Right in front of us, honey! What do
you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Molly! I can tell her by her blue
scarf&mdash;and Kent! Kent, there&rsquo;s your mother
and dear Edwin!&rdquo; Then Judy clutched her young
husband&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Look a little to the right, standing
by your mother&mdash;there&rsquo;s a big man that looks
like Bobby&mdash;See, with a little doll baby woman
in front of him&mdash;he&rsquo;s keeping the crowd off of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
her&mdash;see! see! It is&mdash;it is Bobby and little
Mumsy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy, who not much more than two weeks before
had considered herself the most unfortunate
and friendless of mortals, now knew that there
was not such a happy person in all the world.
How long the vessel took to be made fast to the
pier! And then such a crowding and pushing!
Every one on board seemed to have some one on
the pier he had not seen for centuries and must
get to immediately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be as anxious to hug their mothers
as I am, and I know they haven&rsquo;t any Bobbies,&rdquo;
she complained. &ldquo;And I am sure they
have not been shipwrecked like you and given up
for drowned by their families. They ought to let
us off first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Kean was behaving exactly as though he
were at a football game. He was jumping up
and down and waving and shouting, and his rooting
egged Kent to make a rush for the gangway,
holding Judy like a pigskin; and once on
the gangplank there was nothing to do but push<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
and be pushed by the crowd until they shot out
on the pier into the arms of their waiting and
eager families.</p>

<p>With every one talking at once, it was difficult
to get any accurate knowledge about one another,
but when it was all sifted out it developed that
Mr. and Mrs. Kean had finally been allowed by
the Imperial Government to leave Berlin, in fact,
they had been encouraged to go. Mr. Kean was
looked upon as a dangerous person, a lunatic at
large, and they did not want the responsibility
or expense of caring for him. His jokes got
to be too many and serious, and when he became
such an adept in evading the spy set to watch him
that two had to be detailed for that duty, the
powers that be evidently decided that what knowledge
he possessed of the topography of Turkey
did not outweigh in importance the wearing out
of perfectly good soldier material. He worried
the spy so that he was nothing more than skin
and bones, poor fellow!</p>

<p>They had arrived in New York only the day
before and had immediately got Molly on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
long distance telephone. Of course, they knew
nothing of Judy&rsquo;s being married, but unhesitatingly
approved of the step Kent had taken and
did not consider him at all high-handed. Mr.
Kean, being of a most impulsive disposition, could
understand it in other persons, and little Mrs.
Kean was so used to her comet-like husband and
daughter that she was never astonished by anything
they did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not the impulsive one this time, though,
Bobby,&rdquo; Judy declared when they finally settled
themselves around the luncheon table at the hotel
where a second bridal feast had been prepared,
ordered by the lavish Bobby. &ldquo;It was Kent. I
had no idea of ever being married&mdash;in fact, it
seemed to me to be not quite decent to be married
so quickly when I was in such deep mourning&mdash;The
wedding was quiet because of the recent bereavement&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In mourning! You, Judy, in mourning for
whom?&rdquo; and poor little Mrs. Kean gasped, not
knowing what she was to learn now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, for Kent himself. Nothing but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
bombs dropped in Paris kept me from having my
best serge suit dyed black. Molly, I always said
I&rsquo;d make a fetching widow, and I did all right.
Kent thought I was just lovely in the hat I fixed
for his mourning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Judy! The same old Judy!&rdquo; exclaimed
Molly fondly.</p>

<p>Molly had thought it would be impossible for
her to go to New York to meet the incoming
steamer with its precious cargo, but Edwin had
declared she should go; so little Mildred was
taken on the jaunt as well, with the eager Katy
as nurse. Kizzie was already installed as cook
and Katy was proving a most careful and reliable
nurse. Molly was looking and behaving
more like herself and no longer had to let her
patient husband go off to his lectures like a
bachelor with no wife to pour his coffee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, you and Kent and Mr. and Mrs.
Kean must all come to Wellington to visit us,&rdquo;
announced the hospitable Molly. &ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t they,
Edwin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed they must,&rdquo; said Edwin obediently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
but in his heart wondering where Molly would
put all of them. The old red house on the campus
was large but had not very many rooms. The
young professor could never quite get used to the
Browns and their unbounded hospitality. His
favorite story was one on his mother-in-law; how,
when one of her sons brought home the whole
football team to spend the night, she calmly took
the top mattresses off all the beds (the beds at
Chatsworth were fortunately equipped with box
mattresses and top mattresses) and made up pallets
on the floor, thereby doubling the sleeping
capacity of her hospitable mansion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t come, Molly,&mdash;mighty sorry,&rdquo; said
Kent, &ldquo;but my job must be held down now. They
have kept it open for me long enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I stay with Kent!&rdquo; declared Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah, hurrah! Her mother&rsquo;s own daughter!&rdquo;
cried the delighted Bobby. &ldquo;I was wondering
what kind of wife my girl would make; now
I know. I wouldn&rsquo;t take anything for that: &lsquo;I
stay with Kent.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m going to be terribly domestic. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
found that out while I was living with the Tricots.
What&rsquo;s more, I can make tarts&mdash;the best
ever. I can hardly wait to get a flat and a pastry
board to make some for Kent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might use your drawing board for a
pastry board,&rdquo; teased her father. &ldquo;I fancy art
is through with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Through with, indeed! Why, Bobby, I am
astonished and ashamed of you! I am going to
paint all the time that I am not making tarts,
and what time is left, I am going to knit socks
and make bandages for the wounded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And poor me! When do I come in?&rdquo; asked
Kent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You come in early and behave yourself or I&rsquo;ll
spend the rest of the time making suffrage
speeches,&rdquo; laughed the war bride.</p>

<p class="star">*******</p>

<p>And now since we must leave our friends some
where, what better time and place than at this
second wedding breakfast, while all of them are
together and happy? Perhaps we shall meet them
again when the old red house on the campus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
shall be taxed to its utmost in its endeavor to
behave like Chatsworth. We shall see Judy and
Kent in their little flat and mayhaps taste one
of Judy&rsquo;s tarts. We must know more of Molly&rsquo;s
girls at Wellington and meet dear Nance Oldham
and little Otoyo Sen again. It is hard to
part forever with our friends and those who
know Molly Brown feel that all her friends are
theirs.</p>

<p>So I hope our readers will be glad to meet
again &ldquo;Molly Brown&rsquo;s College Friends.&rdquo;</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
